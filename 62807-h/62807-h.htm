<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> strolled, on a summer day,
from Apsley House towards the then residence of Charles Reade at
Knightsbridge, when I came upon one of those surprises of which
London is still so full to me, even after more than a dozen years
of fond familiarity with its streets and with all that they mean
to the true lover of the Town.&nbsp; For, as I watched the
ceaseless traffic of the turbulent turnings from the great
thoroughfare down towards Chelsea, there came to my mind a phrase
in the pages of its local historian: who, writing but a little
earlier than the year 1830, points with pride to a project just
then formed for the laying out of the latest of these very
streets&mdash;at that day it was a new rural road cut through
fields and swamps&mdash;and by it, he says, &ldquo;Chelsea will
obtain direct connection with London; <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and henceforth must be considered an
integral part of the Great Metropolis of the British
Empire&rdquo;!&nbsp; It is hard to realise that only fifty years
ago Chelsea was a rustic and retired village, far from London:
even as was Islington, fifty years ago, when Charles Lamb,
pensioned and set free from his desk in the India House, retired
to that secluded spot with his sister to live &ldquo;in a
cottage, with a spacious garden,&rdquo; as he wrote; with
&ldquo;the New River, rather elderly by this time, running in
front (if a moderate walking pace can be so termed)&rdquo;: even
as was Kensington&mdash;&ldquo;the old court suburb pleasantly
situated on the great Western road&rdquo;&mdash;just fifty years
ago, when wits and statesmen drove between fields and market
gardens to the rival courts of Gore House and of Holland House;
and N. P. Willis delighted the feminine readers of the <i>New
York Mirror</i> with his gossip about his visits to Lady
Blessington and about the celebrities who bowed before her.&nbsp;
To-day all these villages, along with many even more remote, are
one with London.&nbsp; Yet, more than any of them, has Chelsea
kept its old village character&mdash;albeit preserving but few of
its old village features.&nbsp; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Of the many magnificent mansions
which gave it the name of &ldquo;The Village of Palaces&rdquo;
five alone still stand&mdash;Blacklands, Gough, Lindsey, Stanley
and Walpole Houses&mdash;and these are greatly altered.&nbsp; I
shall show you all of them in our stroll to-day.&nbsp; In between
them, and away beyond them, streets have been cut, new quarters
built: made up in part of &ldquo;genteel&rdquo; villas and rows
of respectable residences; but in great part, also, of cheap
dwellings, of small and shabby shops.&nbsp; These extremes render
much of modern Chelsea utterly uninteresting, except mayhap to
the collector of rents or to the inspector of nuisances.&nbsp;
Yet much of that which is truly ancient and honourable has been
fondly kept untouched, and not ignobly cleaned, as in next-door
Kensington.&nbsp; Alongside this artistic squalor we have the
curious contrast of artistic splendour in a blazing, brand-new
quarter, of which the sacred centre is Tite Street.&nbsp; Here,
amid much that is good and genuine in our modern manner, there is
an aggressive affectation of antiquity shown by the little houses
and studios obtruding on the street, by the grandiose piles of
mansions towering on the embankment: all in <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>raging red
brick, and in the so-called Queen Anne style.&nbsp; The original
article, deadly dull and decorous as it may be, has yet a decent
dignity of its own as a real relic, not found in this painful
pretence of ancient quaintness.&nbsp; This is a quarter, however,
much in vogue; mighty swells dwell here, and here pose some
famous <i>farceurs</i> in art and literature; here, too, work
many earnest men and women in all pursuits of life.&nbsp; These
latter plentifully people every part of Chelsea, for the sake of
the seclusion and the stillness they seek and here find: just as
there settled here for the same reasons, two centuries ago and
earlier, men of learning and of wealth, scholars and nobles, who
kept themselves exclusive by virtue of their birth or their
brains.&nbsp; And so this privileged suburb,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where fruitful Thames salutes the learned
shore,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>came to be in time a place of polite resort: while yet, in the
words of Macaulay, it was but &ldquo;a quiet country village of
about one thousand inhabitants, the baptisms therein averaging a
little more than forty in the year.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the slope
which rises from the river&mdash;as we see it <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>in our print
of those days&mdash;stand, in trim gardens, the grand mansions
which first made the little village famous.&nbsp; Back from these
isolated houses and between them stretch fair fields, and fertile
meadows, and wooded slopes; and along the river bank runs a row
of fishermen&rsquo;s thatched cottages.&nbsp; Here and there on
the shore, are nestled noted taverns and pleasure-gardens, much
frequented by town visitors, reputable or not, coming up the
river on excursions&mdash;as does Pepys, &ldquo;to make merry at
the Swan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gay sings of the place and the period:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then Chelsey&rsquo;s meads o&rsquo;erhear
perfidious vows,<br />
And the press&rsquo;d grass defrauds the grazing cows.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The low river shore, planted with lime and plane trees, is
protected by a slight embankment: first built by the Romans on
the banks above their walled town of London: improved later by
the Norman conquerors; and kept in repair afterward either by
landlord or by tenant, as might be decided in the incessant
disputes between them, still shown on the parish records of that
day.&nbsp; This little embankment <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>is broken here and there by carved
gateways, giving entrance to the grand houses; and by water
staircases&mdash;called, in our print, Ranelagh, Bishop&rsquo;s,
Old Magpye, Beaufort Stairs&mdash;from which a few country
lanes&mdash;such as Pound and Church Lanes and Cheyne
Row&mdash;lead from the river front to the King&rsquo;s
Road.&nbsp; This road had been first a foot-path following the
windings of the river a little inland&mdash;worn perhaps by the
feet of the wandering tribes of Trinobantes&mdash;and had
gradually enlarged itself as the country around became
cultivated.&nbsp; It led from the village of Whitehall through
the woods and fields, across the tidal swamps and the marsh lands
west of Westminster&mdash;partly filled in by the great Cubitt
with the earth dug out in the excavations of St.
Katherine&rsquo;s docks, early in this century: where now
stretches graceful St. James&rsquo;s Park, where now Belgravia is
built so bravely&mdash;and so the road ran to the slopes of
Chelsea, to the first good land close alongside the river which
rose fairly above it.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Such was the secret of the speedy settlement of this secluded
suburb.&nbsp; It was high and healthy, and <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>had easy
access to town by the safe, swift, silent highway of the river;
when few cared to go by the land road, bad enough at its best,
unsafe even in daylight by reason of the foot-pads; but at last
made wide and smooth for his coach by Charles II., recently
restored.&nbsp; He used it as the royal route to Hampton Palace,
and called it the King&rsquo;s Private Road.&nbsp; Even that
exclusive name did not serve to make it safe; and long after
Chelsea Hospital was built, a guard of its pensioners nightly
patrolled, as an escort for honest travellers, from where
Buckingham Palace now stands, across Bloody Bridge,&mdash;at the
edge of present Pimlico,&mdash;and so away through the Five
Fields, &ldquo;where robbers lie in wait,&rdquo; as the
<i>Tatler</i> puts it.&nbsp; For Mr. Dick Steele often went by
this road to Chelsea, where he had a little house somewhere near
the river bank: whereto he was fond of taking &ldquo;a friend to
supper,&rdquo; leaving word at home that he should not be able to
return until the next morning, the roads being so unsafe by
night!&nbsp; Sometimes his friend Addison was with him; sometimes
the latter walked this way alone to his own home, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>at the
farther end of Chelsea; and once on a moonlight night, he
strolled out here with Colonel Esmond, as you may remember.&nbsp;
A few years later, this same walk was frequently taken by Mr.
Jonathan Swift, from Mrs. Vanhomrigh&rsquo;s house in Suffolk
Street, Pall Mall&mdash;where he used to leave his &ldquo;best
gown and periwig,&rdquo; as he tells Stella&mdash;&ldquo;and so
to Chelsea, a little beyond the Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; And still
later, in December, 1754, Smollett was robbed of his watch and
purse&mdash;there was but little in the latter, for he was then
in poor case&mdash;as he went by coach from London to his
residence out in Chelsea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Road,&rdquo; as we see it to-day, in dingy
letters on the old brick or plaster-fronted houses, makes us
almost look for the Merry Monarch&mdash;as history has mis-named
one of her saddest figures&mdash;driving past, on his way to
Hampton Court, in company with a bevy of those beauties who still
lure our senses from out their canvasses on the walls of the old
palace.&nbsp; We see, at intervals along the road, behind its
rusty <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>iron
railings and flagged front-yard and old-time porch, a long low
brick house,</p>
<blockquote><p>. . .&nbsp; &ldquo;whose ancient casements
stare<br />
Like sad, dim eyes, at the retreating years,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as if weary of waiting for their owner to come home from the
Dutch wars.&nbsp; Through narrow archways we catch glimpses of
trees and of gardens.&nbsp; Turning down a rural lane we stroll
into &ldquo;The Vale,&rdquo; and find a clump of cottages,
covered with vines, grown about with greenery; flowers blow,
cocks crow, an air of country unconcern covers the
enclosure.&nbsp; The French gardeners who came here in crowds in
1685, after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and set
Chelsea <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>all a-bloom with their nurseries, have left to their
heirs but a diminished domain; yet although Butterfly Alley,
sought by sauntering swells, has gone, King&rsquo;s Road is still
countrified by its florists: their famous wistarias grow on the
Hospital walls and climb the houses of Cheyne Walk: you still
find their fig-trees in private gardens, their vines on
old-fashioned trellises: they make Chelsea streets all green and
golden with their massed creepers through summer and through
autumn.&nbsp; In unexpected corners you will stumble on a
collection of cosy cottages, like Camera Square; there are a few
rural nooks still left; here and there a woodland walk; and in
dairies hid behind stone streets the cow is milked for you while
you wait to drink the warm milk.</p>
<p>And on the river bank, although the old Roman and the old
Norman wall and walk are replaced by the broad new Embankment and
its smug gardens; although the insolent affectations of the Queen
Anne mania stare stonily down on Cheyne Walk; all these have not
been able to vulgarise this most delightful of promenades.&nbsp;
Starting from Chelsea Barracks we <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>can still walk under the old plane
trees:&mdash;on our right the ancient Dutch-fronted houses, so
prim, so secluded, so reserved; on our left the placid flow of
the storied Thames, broadened here into Chelsea Reach:&mdash;to
dingy, dear old Battersea Bridge, and so on to Sand&rsquo;s
End.&nbsp; At each end of our walk are the two small rivulets
which bounded the old parish east and west; one is now arched
over and flows unseen beneath the tread of busy feet; the other
serves as a railway cutting and carries rattling trains: so the
old-time memories of the place now either flow underground, or
are modernised and become part of its daily life.</p>

<p>In the extreme north-eastern corner as we enter Chelsea we
find Hans Place, a secluded green oval, built about with old-time
two-storied brick houses.&nbsp; In No. 25 was born in 1802 the
poetess, Letitia E. Landon, known as &ldquo;L. E. L.&rdquo;; and
at No. 22 she went to school. <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; At the
farthest south-western point of the <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>parish, just over on the border of
Fulham, stands the old house once tenanted by Nell Gwynne.&nbsp;
At the northern end of Church Street, opposite the Jewish burial
ground, is a public-house, &ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Elm,&rdquo;
perpetuating the memory of the tree, there standing until very
lately, under which Elizabeth sought shelter from a shower, when
strolling in the fields with Burleigh on one of her frequent
visits to Chelsea.&nbsp; On the southern, the river, border of
the parish, lived George Eliot; and here, at No. 4, Cheyne Walk,
she died.&nbsp; Between these spots, marked by the memories of
these four women, so far apart in time, rank, and character, how
much of history and romance do we traverse!</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>In
taking you for a stroll to-day through Old Chelsea we will not
stop to puzzle over the etymology of the name; whether it came
from the Saxon, <i>Chelchythe</i>, or from <i>Chesel</i>, meaning
gravel, and <i>ea</i>, meaning a bank: nor trace it back to its
earliest appearance in Saxon chronicles, in 745, as the Hundred
of Ossulston, Middlesex.&nbsp; You may see, if you choose, in the
British Museum, the Charter of Edward the Confessor giving the
&ldquo;Manor of Chelsey to the Abbot and brothers of the
Ministers of the West,&rdquo; by whom it was rented for four
pounds yearly.&nbsp; But it will not add to the interest of our
stroll to learn that when it was a residence of Offa, King of the
Mercians, there was a &ldquo;Geflit-fullic&rdquo; held here; nor
that they had &ldquo;a contentious synod.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor shall
we altogether partake of the joy of one Maitland, sounding for
many a day up and down the river, and at last finding, on the
eighteenth of September, 1732, the very ford between Chelsea and
Battersea, traversed by C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s army in pursuit of
the flying Britons.&nbsp; For several centuries after the
Conquest, the <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>names Chelcheth or Chelchith were used indifferently; in
the sixteenth century it began to be written Chelsey; and it is
only since about 1795 that the modern spelling has prevailed.</p>
<p>Among the archives of Chelsea may be seen the will, dated in
1369, of the Earl of Warwick; and we know that long before that
year he had come here with the prestige of his prowess at
Poictiers, his courage at Cressy, and had built himself a
house&mdash;the first great nobleman&rsquo;s house erected
here.&nbsp; But we do not know where it stood, nor anything more
of it, than that it was afterwards leased by Richard III. to the
widowed Duchess of Norfolk for the yearly rental of one red
rose.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s is the first house, as well as the
fullest of human interest, of which we have any authentic record
in Chelsea; and it was he who laid the foundations of the
prosperity of the place.&nbsp; He built it for himself in 1520:
glad to go from narrow Bucklersbury in the City to sweet sights
and sounds and air for his young children.&nbsp; For more than
two centuries his house stood here, tenanted by many <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>families,
famous and infamous, until 1740, when it was pulled down.&nbsp;
It is a labour of love, and no difficult one, to reconstruct it
as Bowack saw it: &ldquo;This house is between 200 and 300 feet
in length, has a stately ancient front towards the Thames, also
two spacious courtyards, and behind it are <i>very fine
gardens</i>.&nbsp; It is so pleasantly situated that the late
Queen Mary had a great desire to purchase it before King William
built Kensington Palace, but was prevented by some secret
obstacles.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old view signed &ldquo;L. Knyff del:
1699,&rdquo; shows us a projecting porch in the centre, a dozen
or more generous windows on each floor, four of them oriel; and
above, many gables, turrets, and a small tower.&nbsp; The back
view crowds together, in picturesque confusion, a mass of
casements, close packed gables, and jutting pent-houses.&nbsp;
Such was &ldquo;this pore howse in Chelchith&rdquo; from which
More dated one of his letters; and Erasmus wrote of it that it
was &ldquo;neither mean nor invidiously grand, and so subject to
envy, yet commodious enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; It stood on the slope a
little back from the river, half-way up to the King&rsquo;s Road,
about where Beaufort Street now runs.&nbsp; A spacious <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>garden lay in
front, too, wherein the great Chancellor was wont to walk, as
well as on the gate-house, which, in the words of Aubrey,
&ldquo;was flatt on the top, leaded, from whence is a most
pleasant prospect of the Thames and the fields
beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he walked with his guest Holbein;
sometimes with his friend Ellis Heywood, poet and playwright, who
wrote warmly about &ldquo;this enchanting spot&rdquo;; sometimes
with his King, Henry VIII., who, still posing as a good Catholic
and Defender of the Faith, used to come up the river, drop into
dinner, and saunter afterward in the garden, his arm about
More&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; The son-in-law, Roper, records this with
delight, &ldquo;never having seen the King so familiar with any
one else, except Wolsey.&rdquo;&nbsp; More knew just what all
this was worth, and that his head would count, with the king, for
nothing against &ldquo;say a French city or a
citadel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wolsey&rsquo;s fate&mdash;the fate of so
many others&mdash;howbeit warned none of the rest; else could
they not have forgotten that to every neck on which had hung that
royal ruffian&rsquo;s arm the axe soon came; and that to be his
friend was only a little less dangerous than to be his wife.</p>

<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>In this
garden were the stocks for heretics, and the &ldquo;Jesus
tree,&rdquo; or tree of troth, whereat they were flogged; for
More was fond of suppressing heresy, and failing that, he used to
suppress the heretics, by flinging them into prison.&nbsp; The
resolute old Catholic denied that he had ever laid hands on a
dissident, but it is certain that some one did so by his
orders.&nbsp; Near his house he had put up the &ldquo;newe
buildinge, for the entertainment of distressed old men and
women;&rdquo; and therein was a small chapel, where he spent much
time, praying, and scourging himself with a knotted cord; wearing
next his skin the hair shirt which is still preserved in the
convent of Spilsberg.&nbsp; He was fond of assisting in the
service at the old church, carrying the cross in the procession,
and doing divers duties &ldquo;like a parish clerk.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One day the Duke of Norfolk, coming out to dine with him,
&ldquo;fortuned to finde him in the quier with a surplisse on his
backe, singinge:&rdquo; at the sight of which servile service,
the good worldly duke was moved to wrathful remonstrance.</p>
<p>All this rigidity in religion was but the natural stand of a
strong character against the drift of the times and <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>the current
that was carrying crowds down with the king; and it narrowed none
in the least this man&rsquo;s broad spirit, nor touched for the
worse his quaint, gentle humour, his fine wit, his sweet and
wholesome nature.&nbsp; It was he who had said, in better
balanced days:&mdash;&ldquo;A man may live for the next world,
yet be merry withal:&rdquo; his was the dainty description of
Jane Shore in her youth:&mdash;&ldquo;Proper she was and fair;
nothing in hir body that you would have changed, but if you would
have wished hir somewhat higher;&rdquo; and his that pitiful
picture of her old age and misery.&nbsp; It was of him that
Erasmus wrote these beautiful words: &ldquo;There was not any man
living who was so affectionate to his children as he; and he
loveth his old wife as well as if she were a young
maid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was she only &ldquo;old,&rdquo; but, in
the words of More&rsquo;s grandson, &ldquo;of good yeares, of no
good favour nor complexion, nor very rich; her disposition very
near and worldly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, she was his second wife;
and to her&mdash;selfish, grasping, hard, nagging&mdash;this man
grandly gave unswerving devotion to the very last.&nbsp; His was,
indeed, an ideal household into which I like to look; all <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>dwelling
together in affectionate amity; father, mother, the son and his
wife, the three daughters&mdash;&ldquo;the
Moric&aelig;&rdquo;&mdash;and their husbands, with all the
grandchildren; and the orphan girl, Margery Giggs, adopted as a
daughter by More, &ldquo;and as dear to him as if she were his
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is work for all, and &ldquo;no wrangling,
no idle word was heard; no one was idle,&rdquo; Erasmus tells
us.&nbsp; All the female folk study too&mdash;a rare thing then,
for More was centuries ahead of his time in his larger views of
woman&rsquo;s education, as he&mdash;the greatest minister of
Humanism&mdash;was in political and in mightier matters.&nbsp;
Pithily he put it: &ldquo;It mattereth not, in harvest time,
whether the corn were sown by a man or a woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
his table&mdash;his dining-hour was doubtless late, for he urges
this boon among the other wise innovations of his
&ldquo;Utopia&rdquo;&mdash;met the &ldquo;best society&rdquo; of
England, and famous foreign guests.&nbsp; Perhaps it was here
that Erasmus sat, greatest of scholars and divines, himself
easily first of all that notable band; admiring, as he owns,
Grocyn&rsquo;s vast range of knowledge, and Linacre&rsquo;s
subtle, deep, fine judgment; seeming to hear Plato speak, as he
listens to Colet&mdash;him who founded St. Paul&rsquo;s
School&mdash;<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>and wondering &ldquo;did nature ever frame a disposition
more gentle, more sweet, more happy,&rdquo; than that of his
host!</p>
<p>From this home, More was taken to a prison, by his good
King.&nbsp; He had refused, by countenancing Henry&rsquo;s
divorce, to debase himself and his great office, and had stepped
down from it on May 16, 1533, with even greater joy than he had
stepped up to it on Wolsey&rsquo;s disgrace, four years
previously.&nbsp; So he retired to this Chelsea mansion with but
one hundred pounds a year income left to him; after so many years
of high and of lucrative office.&nbsp; Here he bothered no more
about public concerns, but busied himself with the welfare of his
household, preparing his family and himself for the end which he
saw coming.&nbsp; It came soon enough; and when he refused to
violate his conscience by acknowledging Henry&rsquo;s supremacy
over that of the Pope as the head of the Church, and by taking
the oath of succession (under which Anne Boleyn&rsquo;s children
were to be acknowledged the lawful heirs to the crown), he was
carried down the river to the Tower; and there imprisoned for a
whole year, in the very cell, it is said, <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>wherein he
had sat as grand inquisitor, aforetime racking heretics.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very nigh Heaven,&rdquo; he said it was, looking up
contentedly from this narrow tenement.&nbsp; At nine
o&rsquo;clock of the morning of July 16, 1535, he was led to the
block on Tower Hill and there beheaded.&nbsp; You may walk there
and look on the place to-day: but lately found and fixed on,
railed in and paved.&nbsp; His courage and his constancy had
never once failed him, save as he was being brought back to his
cell after his trial in Westminster Hall; when his favourite
daughter, Margaret Roper, waiting among the crowd on Tower
Wharf&mdash;learning his sentence by the token of the blade of
the headsman&rsquo;s axe turned towards him&mdash;broke through
the guards, and clung to his neck, kissing him and sobbing,
&ldquo;Oh, my father!&rdquo; with no other words uttered.&nbsp;
Then for a moment the father in him was unmanned, as he moaned,
&ldquo;My Meg!&rdquo; and kissed her for the last time.&nbsp; On
the morning of his execution he was cheerful and even jocular:
&ldquo;I pray you, master Lieutenant,&rdquo; said he at the
scaffold-steps, &ldquo;see me safe up, and for my coming down I
can shift for myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He put aside his beard <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>out of the
axe&rsquo;s reach&mdash;&ldquo;for <i>it</i> has never committed
treason&rdquo;&mdash;and so laid his reverend head on the block;
too noble a head to drop in so worthless a cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dauntless soul erect, who smiled at death,&rdquo; is
Thomson&rsquo;s fitting phrase.&nbsp; And Erasmus wrote:
&ldquo;All lament his death as the loss of their own father or
brother.&nbsp; I myself have seen tears come from those men who
never saw More. . . .&nbsp; How many souls hath that axe wounded
which cut off More&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where they buried his body has always been matter of
conjecture.&nbsp; In a record, printed in 1726, his
great-grandson says: &ldquo;His trunke was interred in Chelsey
Church, near the middle of the south wall;&rdquo; but other
records tell us that it was inhumed beneath the Tower Chapel; and
it seems certain that no one will ever really know the truth
about this.&nbsp; We do know, however, that his head was exposed
on a spike above London Bridge, &ldquo;where as traytors&rsquo;
heads are sett upon poles; having remained some moneths there,
being to be cast into the Thames, because roome should be made
for diverse others, who in plentiful sorte suffered <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>martyrdome
for the same supremacie.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was taken away by
Margaret Roper, by bribery or stealth; &ldquo;least&mdash;as she
stoutly affirmed before the Councell, being called before them
for the same matter&mdash;it should be foode for fishes; which
she buried where she thought fittest.&rdquo;&nbsp; This spot was
found&mdash;in 1835, after just three centuries of doubt&mdash;to
be in the vault of the Roper family in St. Dunstan&rsquo;s
Church, Canterbury: and there his head remains to-day &ldquo;in a
leaden box something in the shape of a bee-hive, open in the
front, and with an iron grating before it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my visits to Canterbury, as I stroll down its delightful
old street to St. Dunstan&rsquo;s, I pause always in front of the
ancient carved stone gateway&mdash;all that is left of the Roper
mansion&mdash;fancying I see that devoted daughter hurrying home,
secretly and by night, carrying her beloved burden in a silver
casket: carrying it all the way in her own hands, fearful of
entrusting it to those of any other.&nbsp; Most lovable as well
as most learned among women&mdash;&ldquo;her humility equal to
her learning,&rdquo; &ldquo;no woman, that could speak so well,
did speak so little,&rdquo; says old Fuller in his
&ldquo;Worthies&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Margaret Roper holds her high place
among the Fair Women of England, and her story is very near the
first in the Legend of Good Women.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Morn broadened on the borders of the
dark,<br />
Ere I saw her, who clasped in the last trance<br />
Her murder&rsquo;d father&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, amid all the thronging shadows which people
Chelsea&rsquo;s shore, there walks no more vivid personality than
his, as it moves before us through all his characteristic career;
from the day he was taken from his school in Threadneedle Street,
and made page-boy to Cardinal Morten, who said of him, seeing
already his promise of wit and of worth: &ldquo;This child here,
waiting at table, whosoever shall live to see it, will prove a
marvellous man;&rdquo; then to Oxford on his scanty allowance;
thence to New Inn and to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, studying law by his
father&rsquo;s desire, albeit longing himself for the pulpit;
then law-reader of Furnivall&rsquo;s Inn, whence he was called to
the bar at the age of twenty-one, and so going to live
&ldquo;religiously yet without vow&rdquo; in the Charter-House;
lecturing in St. Lawrence, <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Old Jewry, on Augustine&rsquo;s
&ldquo;City of God,&rdquo; listened to by &ldquo;all the chief
learned of London&rdquo;; patiently practising his profession,
taking &ldquo;no fee of Widow, Orphane, or poor person&rdquo;;
becoming famous, near and far, for his capacity, learning,
integrity; and thus elected to the House of Commons when only
twenty-three, and soon made Speaker; rapidly rising to the
highest place in the realm, that of Lord High Chancellor; and
then, as he passed daily to his seat on the woolsack, stopping
always before his aged father, who sat, as judge of the court of
the King&rsquo;s Bench, in William Rufus&rsquo;s Hall at
Westminster, and &ldquo;reverently kneeling down in the sight of
all, ask his blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the gallery of Old Masters at Brussels, I found lately,
after long searching, a diminutive dark canvas set in a black
frame, with a small gilt column on each side; its tiny tablet
bears the inscription: &ldquo;Holbein le jeune,
1497&ndash;1543.&nbsp; Thomas Morus.&rdquo;&nbsp; This most
attractive painting shows a table on which lies a small dog,
peering at his master who sits behind; in More&rsquo;s right
hand, one finger between the leaves, he holds a book; his left
hand grips his dark gown at the neck; <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>a flat cap is on his head; a short
curling beard, steadfast honest eyes, a plain, resolute, shrewd,
strong face:&mdash;this is the man &ldquo;in his habit as he
lived&rdquo; in the later years of his good life.</p>
<p>This portrait&mdash;as well as the more famous group of More
and his family, now in Nostell Priory&mdash;was painted by Hans
Holbein, <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a> while he was living with More.&nbsp; He
had grown tired of his dissipated life in Basle and of his wife,
and had come to England with a letter of introduction to More,
from Erasmus, whose portrait Holbein had just finished in Basle;
and More was so pleased with the man that he gave him a home with
himself.&nbsp; Here were passed three of the happiest years of
the great painter&rsquo;s life, during which he did much good
work.&nbsp; Some of this was shown to the king on one of his
visits, More having hung several of the portraits in a fine light
for that purpose; and they so charmed the delicate-minded monarch
that he asked, <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;if such an artist were still alive, and to be had
for money?&rdquo;&nbsp; So it came to pass that Holbein, on
losing his good friend, entered the king&rsquo;s service, and
there remained until his own death.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After More&rsquo;s execution, and the confiscation of his
property&mdash;which is a tautological way of speaking of any of
Henry&rsquo;s murders&mdash;the house passed through many hands,
noble and base, clean and dirty; and while everything is of
interest concerning walls which, in Cicero&rsquo;s words,
&ldquo;could give such good reason for their fame,&rdquo; it
would be but dry detail to follow their forlorn fortunes
fully.&nbsp; Of the noblemen and courtiers who dwelt here, few
are worthy our notice: but I may mention that as early as 1586
Lord and Lady Dacre had bought the house and estate; and here her
brother, Thomas Sackville, often visited her, and from here many
of his letters are dated.&nbsp; Here he may have written his
&ldquo;Gorbudic,&rdquo; the first English Tragedy.&nbsp; It was
Sackville who was sent to tell Queen Mary of Scots that her
sentence was signed, and he it was who saw it executed.&nbsp; <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Lady Dacre,
surviving her husband, willed the place to the great Lord
Burleigh; and so it came to his son, Lord Robert Cecil,
afterwards Earl of Salisbury.&nbsp; He rebuilt the house and
improved the place in 1619, so that even then it was &ldquo;the
greatest house in Chelsey.&rdquo;&nbsp; So great that, later,
James I. found it just the place he wanted for his favourite
&ldquo;dear Steenie,&rdquo; first Duke of Buckingham; giving its
owner, then Craufield, Earl of Middlesex, snug lodgings in the
Tower, in exchange.&nbsp; Charles I., as deeply infatuated with
the Duke as his royal father had been, gave the estate out and
out to him, in 1627; and his it remained until the Commonwealth
seized on it.</p>
<p>His son, George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham&mdash;a
man worthy of, and worse even than his sire&mdash;regained the
property by his shifty marriage with the daughter of Fairfax, and
it was confirmed to him on the Restoration; but in 1664 it was
sold, along with all the other estates of this poor and
profligate scoundrel&mdash;the last and the lowest of the
Villiers.&nbsp; He was the Zimri of Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Absalom
and Achitophel&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>. . . &ldquo;everything by starts and nothing long;<br
/>
But, in the course of one revolving moon,<br />
Was Chymist, Fidler, Statesman, and Buffoon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p>Beggar&rsquo;d by fools, when still he found too late<br />
He had his jest and they had his estate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Pope tells us, in his stinging verse, how &ldquo;this lord
of useless thousands ends&rdquo; his ignoble life, deserted and
despised:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the worst inn&rsquo;s worst room, with
mat half hung,<br />
The floor of plaister and the walls of dung,<br />
On once a flock bed, but repair&rsquo;d with straw,<br />
With tape-tied curtains, never meant to draw;<br />
The George and Garter dangling from that bed<br />
Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red;<br />
Great Villiers lies!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the Earl of Bristol who bought the place from
Buckingham, and it is at this time that we meet with a notice of
it in Evelyn&rsquo;s diary under the date 15th January,
1678&ndash;9: &ldquo;Went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsey and
dined with the Countesse of Bristol in the greate house, formerly
the Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s, a spacious and excellent place,
for the extent of ground <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>and situation in good aire.&nbsp; The
house is large but ill-contrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1682 the Marquis of Worcester, afterwards Duke of Beaufort,
became the owner of the mansion; and from him it was named
Beaufort House, thereafter always called so.&nbsp; He selected
this place that he might live, says Strype, &ldquo;in an air he
thought much healthier, and near enough to the town for
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1738 Sir Hans Sloane bought the house
and soon after pulled it down; giving the famous Inigo
Jones-gateway to the Earl of Burlington, who removed it to
Chiswick, where it stands to-day in the gardens of the Duke of
Devonshire&rsquo;s Chiswick House, not far from the statue of the
architect.&nbsp; It was on meeting its disjointed stones, as they
were being carted away, that Alexander Pope wrote the well-known
lines:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Passenger</i>: &ldquo;O Gate, how com&rsquo;st
thou here?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Gate</i>: &ldquo;I was brought from Chelsea last year,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Batter&rsquo;d with wind and weather;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Inigo Jones put me together;<br />
Sir Hans Sloane<br />
Let me alone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burlington brought me hither.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Do not
think, however, that this gateway is the only relic of
More&rsquo;s mansion; for the persevering prowler may find still
another, well worth the search.&nbsp; Where King&rsquo;s Road
curves about to Millman&rsquo;s Street&mdash;known on the old
maps of those days as the Lovers&rsquo; Walk, &ldquo;A Way to
Little Chelsea&rdquo;&mdash;an ancient gateway gave entrance to
More&rsquo;s back garden and stables, and through it we may now
pass into the Moravian Burial Ground.&nbsp; Here, in the
peacefullest spot in all London, lie in rows, men and women on
opposite sides, our Moravian brothers and sisters,
&ldquo;departed,&rdquo; as their little headstones, in their
touching simplicity, tell us.&nbsp; Grass grows above them, great
trees guard them; trees perhaps planted by More himself.&nbsp;
For this was part of the &ldquo;very fine gardens&rdquo; which
Bowack speaks of; and that massive wall at the farther end was
built in the century which saw the Armada.&nbsp; In among the
gardens of the houses beyond, may be found other bits of wall;
all built of very narrow bricks, such as we trace in More&rsquo;s
chapel in Chelsea Old Church; bricks made only then, peculiar to
that period, not seen since.&nbsp; This largest piece we are
looking at is still solid enough, <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>though bulging here and there with
its weight of over three hundred years, its bricks black with age
and smoke; here are the traces of beams once set in it, here is a
bit of an archway, there the remains of a fireplace.&nbsp; Thomas
More&rsquo;s arm rested on this wall: it is part of him, and he
mutely bequeaths it to our care.&nbsp; It is well that we should
claim salvage for this bit of wreckage thrown upon the beach of
Time, with his mark upon it.</p>
<p>The little brick cottage of the keeper of the graveyard is
overrun with vines, and answers to the assurance of the antiquity
of all within the enclosure.&nbsp; The long low building of one
room formerly serving as the Moravian Chapel is now used for a
Sunday School.&nbsp; As I glance through the windows in this
Sunday sunset I see boys wriggling on board benches, struggling
with big Bible names, and mad for the fresh air and the freedom
outside; one belated boy, trying at the locked gate, does not
look unhappy at being refused entrance.&nbsp; There are memorial
tablets on the chapel walls; one of them bears the name of
&ldquo;Christian Renatus, Count of Zinzendorf&rdquo;; another

were the son and daughter of the great Zinzendorf; and to tell
how these came here I must give you the story of another great
Chelsea mansion, Lindsey House. <a name="citation57"></a><a

<p>It still stands slightly slant-wise to the river road, just
west of the quaint group of houses on the corner of Cheyne Walk
and Beaufort Street.&nbsp; Its front has been stuccoed, and it
has been otherwise modernized; but it has not been entirely
robbed of its old-fashioned stateliness.&nbsp; The five separate
dwellings into which it <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>was long ago divided have harboured
some famous tenants; Martin the painter lived in that one which
still inherits the old name, &ldquo;Lindsey House.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here, too, lived Brunel, the great engineer; Bramah, famous for
his locks, in another.&nbsp; It was the Earl of Lindsey, who,
about 1674, built this grand new mansion on the site of a former
house: between Beaufort House, you see, and the river.&nbsp; It
remained in his family until 1750, when it was bought by Count
Zinzendorf as a residence for himself and the Moravian Brethren
of whom he was the head: and at the same time he bought from Sir
Hans Sloane the stables of More&rsquo;s mansion to be used as a
chapel, and his garden for a graveyard.&nbsp; Zinzendorf was a
man of a rare nature, lifted above all that is petty and paltry
in ordinary life: a spiritual knight, he had founded in his
youth, at Halle, a sort of knighthood, &ldquo;The Slaves of
Virtue&rdquo; and also the &ldquo;Order of the Grain of Mustard
Seed;&rdquo; teaching his disciples there, teaching the Dutchmen
in Holland, and the negroes in Pennsylvania, <a
name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a> later&mdash;<a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>teaching and preaching all his
life&mdash;the brotherhood of man, the essential unity of all
forms of religion.&nbsp; A true Catholic, his aim in life was to
unite all sects.&nbsp; As head and guardian of his little body of
Herrnhuters, he had used his own fortune to buy 100,000 acres of
land in North Carolina, from Lord Granville, in 1749; and in the
following year he bought this property at Chelsea.&nbsp; But no
part of it now belongs to the Moravians, except this
burial-ground; still in use, as we have seen, having been
exempted by special provision from the Act of 1855, which closed
the other intramural graveyards of London, by reason of this one
burying but one body in each grave, and that so deeply.</p>

<p>The name of Pennsylvania just mentioned comes to us again as
we walk a little further west; for its famous <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>founder,
William Penn, is oddly enough associated with the notorious
Cremorne Gardens, which lay just here.&nbsp; The very name of
this haunt of feasting and flirting by a peculiar irony was
derived from the Viscount Cremorne, its former owner, &ldquo;this
most excellent man,&rdquo; known, even when plain Thomas Dawson,
before his peerage, as a model of all that was steady and
sedate.&nbsp; His second wife, the great-granddaughter of William
Penn, was named Philadelphia, from the city of her birth&mdash;a
good woman, whose character, her funeral sermon assures us,
&ldquo;it was difficult to delineate.&rdquo;&nbsp; She, becoming
Lady Cremorne, and outliving her husband, inherited this charming
villa and grounds, called Chelsea Farm; and left it at her death,
in 1825, to her nephew, Granville Penn, &ldquo;one of the
Hereditary Governors and Proprietaries of the late Province of
Pennsylvania.&rdquo;&nbsp; He soon sold it, and it became a den
of drinking, dancing, devilry.&nbsp; The ancient gilded barge,
&ldquo;The Folly,&rdquo; moored on its river front, was once more
the scene of just such orgies as it had known in its youth,
during the roystering days of the Restoration.</p>
<p>Past the prim and proper brick cottages, past the innocent <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>nursery
garden, which cover wicked old Cremorne: through new streets and
crescents built on the site of the famous Ashburnham
estate&mdash;where, in old days, stretched the great gardens of
the learned Dr. Cadogan, filled with rarest medicinal plants: out
beyond the high brick wall, massive with reserve and
respectability, behind which hides old Stanley House&mdash;built
by Sir Arthur Gorges, who was embalmed in his friend
Spenser&rsquo;s verse as Alcyon, for his talents and his conjugal
affection, and who was here visited once by Queen Elizabeth; her
thrifty-minded majesty accepting, as was her wont, the customary
gift of greeting, &ldquo;a faire jewell,&rdquo; from her
host:&mdash;so we come to the westernmost edge of Chelsea.&nbsp;
Here, standing on the little bridge which carries King&rsquo;s
Road across the deep railway cutting into Sand&rsquo;s End,
Fulham, we look over to an old plaster-fronted house, once known
as Sandford Manor House.&nbsp; This was one of the many
residences of Mistress Eleanor Gwynne; and in it, a hundred years
after her, lived Joseph Addison.&nbsp; It has been newly
plastered, the sloping roof raised a little, and the wings long
since torn down; but <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>it has been very slightly modernized
otherwise; and Mr. McMinn, its occupant, with rare and real
reverence has preserved its antique features; all the more marked
by their contrast with the great modern gasometers beyond.&nbsp;
Within, its square hall retains the old wainscotting, and the
staircase remains as when Charles II. rode up it on his pony, for
a freak.&nbsp; The delightful little back garden is perhaps
hardly altered since those days, except that the four walnut
trees <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>which Charles is said to have planted in the front
garden have gone to decay and have recently been uprooted.&nbsp;
At its foot, where now the railway cuts through, once ran
&ldquo;the creek with barges gliding deep, beside the long
grass,&rdquo; on the banks of which Addison went bird-nesting, in
search of eggs for the young Earl of Warwick.&nbsp; This was when
he was thinking of marrying the lad&rsquo;s mother, and the
letters&mdash;still in existence&mdash;which he wrote from here
to the little ten-year-old earl, are as genuine and charming as
anything which ever came from his pen.&nbsp; One of them begins:
&ldquo;The business of this is to invite you to a concert of
music, which I have found out in the neighbouring
wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wish space allowed me to quote more of these
letters.&nbsp; Although they are dated simply at Sand&rsquo;s
End, none other than Sandford House has ever stood which can make
entirely good the descriptions of that country retreat,
&ldquo;whereto Mr. Addison often retires in summer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What would one not give to have been invited out there, on such
an evening as Thackeray tells us of?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the time came to leave, Esmond marched
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>homeward
to his lodgings, and met Mr. Addison on the road, walking to a
cottage which he had at Fulham, the moon shining on his handsome
serene face.&nbsp; &lsquo;What cheer, brother?&rsquo; says
Addison, laughing: &lsquo;I thought it was a foot-pad advancing
in the dark, and behold, it is an old friend.&nbsp; We may shake
hands, Colonel, in the dark; &rsquo;tis better than fighting by
daylight.&nbsp; Why should we quarrel because thou art a Whig and
I am a Tory?&nbsp; Turn thy steps and walk with me to Fulham,
where there is a nightingale still singing in the garden, and a
cool bottle in a cave I know of.&nbsp; You shall drink to the
Pretender, if you like.&nbsp; I will drink my liquor in my own
way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the corner of the little turning which leads to this house
there stands a tavern called &ldquo;The Nell Gwynne;&rdquo; this,
at the extreme western end of the parish, is matched by another
of the same name on its easternmost edge; and between these two
public-houses we may track many other footprints of this fair
lady, &ldquo;with whom, for all her frailties, the English <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>people can
never be angry,&rdquo; as Peter Cunningham well says.&nbsp; She
has left her trace on Chelsea, as she left it in her time on the
light-minded monarch: both shown even yet in Chelsea Hospital,
according to that tradition and popular belief which credit her
with its founding.&nbsp; To this day the old pensioners worship
her as their patron saint!&nbsp; It is true that Louis XIV. had
probably given the notion to the English King by his foundation a
few years before of the <i>Invalides</i> as a retreat for French
veterans; it is true that as early as 1666 Evelyn had sent to
Pepys, as Clerk of the Admiralty, a scheme for an Infirmary for
Disabled English Sailors.&nbsp; In his diary, January 27,
1681&ndash;82, Evelyn says: &ldquo;This evening Sir Stephen Fox
acquainted me again with his Majesty&rsquo;s resolution of
proceeding in the erection of a Royal Hospital for emerited
soldiers;&rdquo; and it is a matter of record that Sir Stephen
Fox, first Paymaster-General of the Forces, was the potent factor
in the founding.&nbsp; This may well be, but it is at least
plausible, and certainly pleasant, to believe that this
good-hearted woman, by a judicious and timely movement, brought
about a sudden solution <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>of the question, which had been only
in suspension in the King&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; The general
destitution of the discharged soldiers after the Restoration had
become a scandal to the King and to the country.&nbsp; In olden
times such men had found bread and ale and a night&rsquo;s rest
in monastic houses; but all this had been done away with by the
Dissolution.&nbsp; Now, the poor old fellows, who have known
nothing all their lives but wars and camps, wander about, lame,
hungry, helpless, in these dismal times of peace.&nbsp; Even when
able to work, there is no work for them.&nbsp; Old John Hill,
serving in the ranks all his life, and now turned adrift to carry
the weight of eighty-two years, succeeds after long suing in
being appointed to the poor post of beadsman at Gloucester, only
to find that the King had just given it to another old soldier,
and had forgotten it.&nbsp; So it was all over the kingdom.&nbsp;
Nell Gwynne, seeing daily these warriors hobbling
about,&mdash;the younger ones wounded for her lover at Dunbar and
Worcester, the elder ones for her lover&rsquo;s father at Naseby
and Marston Moor,&mdash;was touched by the sight: she had been
poor herself, yet strangely enough in her <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>prosperity
she was always prone to pity poverty.&nbsp; They say that one
day, a shabby soldier just escaped from Tangiers&mdash;probably
an impostor&mdash;begged at her carriage door; and she drove
home, and urged the King to do something for these disabled
servants of the State.&nbsp; And they say, too, that the shifty
monarch, in giving the land for the hospital, made a pretty good
thing of it for himself!</p>
<p>There had been already a building on the ground, then nearly
in ruins, the foundation walls of which may still be seen in the
cellar of the chaplain&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; This was King
James&rsquo;s aborted College for polemic divinity&mdash;&ldquo;A
Colledge of Divines and other Learned Men at
Chelsey&rdquo;&mdash;nicknamed &ldquo;Controversy College,&rdquo;
and intended to be &ldquo;a spiritual garrison, with a magazine
of all books.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a failure.&nbsp; Nobody would
subscribe, for every man was giving his money, at this time, to
repair St. Paul&rsquo;s, and to help Sir Hugh Myddleton bring the
New River into London; and only one-eighth of the plan was ever
carried out.&nbsp; The Royal Society used the building for a
while; in one of its out-houses Prince Rupert invented the drops,
which, <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>in
Macaulay&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;have long amused children and
puzzled philosophers&rdquo;; and by which, absurdly enough, his
name is still kept alive; albeit his is a memorable figure,
gallant in battle, ardent in love, devoted in science.&nbsp; When
he laid down the rapier for the retort, the broadsword for the
blowpipe, he pursued chemistry even as he had pursued the flying
Roundheads at Edge Hill, with equal ardour here on the quiet
shore at Chelsea, far from the court and the crowd.&nbsp; Later,
the buildings, falling to pieces, were used even in 1653, along
with barges moored on the river front, as a prison for the Dutch
taken in the war.&nbsp; Grave John Evelyn, one of the four
Commissioners in control of all prisoners of war&mdash;he had
rode with Rupert as a volunteer&mdash;comes to visit his charges
on Ash Wednesday, 1665, and notes: &ldquo;They only complained
that their bread was too fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the site fixed on for the new infirmary; and in the
<i>Monthly Recorder</i> of February 17, 1682, you may read:
&ldquo;His Majesty went to Chelsey Colledge to lay the first
stone, with several of the nobility, which is a place designed to
be built and endowed by His <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Majesty for the relief of Indigent
Officers, and Incouragement to serve His Majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp;
William and Mary finished the edifice; and it stands&mdash;an
impressive monument of that union of proportion and of fitness by
which Christopher Wren gave beauty to his plainest
designs&mdash;in stately solidity in the midst of its thirty
acres of ground.&nbsp; It is handsomely supported, not only by
government aid, but by valuable donations.&nbsp; There are nearly
eighty thousand out-pensioners and over five hundred inmates;
these latter divided into companies, and doing mimic garrison
duty in memory of their active days.&nbsp; Prints of their
popular commanders hang all round the walls of the great hall
west of the grand entrance, once a dining-room, now used for
reading and smoking.&nbsp; In glass cases are the war medals left
by veterans dying with no surviving relatives to claim them: on
one we find nearly a dozen battles of the Peninsular campaigns;
on another Badajos and Lucknow figure in curious conjunction; and
rarest of all is one whose owner fought at Inkerman, Balaclava,
and the Alma.&nbsp; In this hall the body of the great Duke lay
in state amid the memorials of his victories, guarded <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>by his own
veterans: successors of those other veterans exultant over the
news of Waterloo, whom Wilkie had painted, years before, for the
Duke himself.</p>

<p>Framed on the wall is a record of the battles, sieges, marches
of the Coldstream Guards; which tells us that this famous body is
the sole surviving representative of the force which placed
Charles II. on the throne, and thus became the nucleus of the
standing army of England.&nbsp; The corps had been formed in 1650
by General George Monk, who made drafts of picked men from the
various Cromwellian regiments, and led them on that famous march
on the first day of the year 1660, from Coldstream to London,
which saved the monarchy and gave the guard its historic
name.&nbsp; In the chapel, beneath Sebastian Ricci&rsquo;s great
altar-piece, and under the tattered battle-flags, drooping faded
and forlorn, you may see, on any Sunday, Hubert Herkomer&rsquo;s
picture in real life.&nbsp; It is a touching scene, this entry of
the veterans into their chapel, preceded by their fife and drum:
still more touching, the funeral of one of their dead, as they
parade painfully from the infirmary, the lone drummer and fife
playing the Dead March in <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Saul.&nbsp; In the quiet old
burying-ground hard by, they lie compactly enough, the dead
soldiers; and among them, women who have fought and died in
men&rsquo;s attire, their sex unsuspected until their death.</p>
<p>Not only in this burial-ground, but in the quadrangles and
courts, and everywhere about, there rests an air of repose, of
forgetfulness of the turbulent world without.&nbsp; Here, about
the spacious central quadrangle, on massive wooden benches, loaf
and smoke and chat the contented old boys; and growl, withal, in
their content.&nbsp; They decorate Grinling Gibbons&rsquo; bronze
statue of Charles II., posing as a Roman in the centre, with oak
garlands on &ldquo;Oak-Apple-Day,&rdquo; May 29th, the
anniversary of the Restoration; on that day they wear oak
branches in their caps, and eat much plum-pudding at
dinner.&nbsp; Open towards the river, this quadrangle looks out
on gracious gardens; just beyond is the great cross, set there to
honour the victims of the Sepoy mutiny: &ldquo;Some died in
battle, some of wounds, some of disease, <span
class="smcap">All</span> in the devoted performance of
Duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; A little farther out rises the obelisk
commemorating those who fell on that dark <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>and doubtful
day at Chillian-wallah, January 13th, 1849.&nbsp; As we stand
here, beside a quiet Quaker cannon, these memorials to the
devoted dead lift themselves directly in front; the terraced
gardens slope to the river bank, their &ldquo;carpet-beds&rdquo;
yellow with the tints of approaching autumn; the graceful towers
and swaying chains of Chelsea Suspension Bridge seem floating in
the air yonder; above the drooping limes and elms of the
embankment the slim spars of lazy sloops slip slowly by; the
gleaming river glides beneath, and away over beyond it the
feathery masses of the trees of Battersea Park stand solidly
against the sky.&nbsp; The opulent summer sun floods the scene,
and an enchanting stillness broods above all, broken only by the
rare rumble of trains on the farther railway-bridge.&nbsp; All
things are half hid in the exquisite English haze: it softens
every sharpness, harmonizes every harshness, rounds every shape
to grace.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Old Soldiers have their own gardens near at hand, and as
we stroll there we pass College Fields, <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>perpetuating
the name of King James&rsquo;s College; and so on between double
rows of lime trees, gnarled and bent, under which the amorous
veterans flirt sedately with the demure nursemaids, whose
neglected charges meanwhile play with the sheep.&nbsp; Through
the gate we enter a small but well-arranged domain, divided into
tiny squares; each planted by its owner in flowers or in
vegetables as may suit him, so giving him a little more tobacco
money by his sales.&nbsp; They seem fond of those plants which
put themselves most in evidence; and their little gardens are all
aglow with gorgeous hollyhocks, dahlias, sunflowers, of the most
gigantic and highly coloured kinds.&nbsp; It is a delight to
watch the old fellows of a summer afternoon, bending intent on
their toil in shirt-sleeves; or stalking stiffly about in their
long red coats, senilely chaffing and cackling!</p>
<p>You will be pleased, I hope, to learn that this little piece
of ground is called Ranelagh Gardens, and is the sole surviving
remnant of that famous resort so dear to an older
generation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The R:<sup>t</sup> Hon:<sup>ble</sup>
Richard Earle of Ranelagh,&rdquo; as he is styled on the original
&ldquo;Ground <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>Plot of the Royal Hospital&rdquo; in the British Museum,
being made one of the three commissioners appointed in the
beginning to manage the young asylum, leases to himself seven
acres of its grounds on the east, lying along the river, and
there builds a grand mansion, in 1691; the gardens of which are
&ldquo;curiously kept and elegantly designed: so esteemed the
best in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; This first Earl of Ranelagh has
been one of the pupils of a certain schoolmaster named John
Milton, probably at his house in Barbican in the City, so
recently torn down.&nbsp; The Earl becomes a famous man, in a
different line from his teacher, and dying in 1712, leaves
Ranelagh House and its gardens to his son; who sells the place in
1733 to Lacy, Garrick&rsquo;s partner in the Drury Lane theatre
patent; to be made by him a place of open-air amusement, after
the manner of the favourite Vauxhall.&nbsp; But &ldquo;it has
totally beat Vauxhall,&rdquo; writes Horace Walpole.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nobody goes anywhere else, everybody goes there.&nbsp; My
Lord Chesterfield is so fond of it, that he says he has ordered
all his letters to be directed thither.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course,
he has his sneer at the &ldquo;rival mobs&rdquo; of the two
places; but he does not <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>disdain to show himself a very swell
mob&rsquo;s man, in his famous carouse at Ranelagh, with Miss
Ashe and Lady Caroline Petersham.&nbsp; His father, Sir Robert,
was proud to parade here his lovely mistress, Miss Chudleigh;
&ldquo;not over clothed,&rdquo; as Leigh Hunt delicately puts
it.&nbsp; The manners and morals of this place and this time have
never been so pithily presented as in George Selwyn&rsquo;s
<i>mot</i>, on hearing that one of the waiters had been convicted
of robbery: &ldquo;What a horrid idea he&rsquo;ll give of us to
those fellows in Newgate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this distance, however, the f&ecirc;tes, frolics,
fire-works and all the fashionable frivolity of the place look
bright and bewildering.&nbsp; Nor did grave and reverend men
disdain to spend their evenings at Ranelagh&mdash;&ldquo;to give
expansion and gay sensation to the mind,&rdquo; as staid old Dr.
Johnson asserted!&nbsp; Goldsmith felt its gaiety, when he came
here to forget the misery of his lodging in Green Arbour Court,
where now stands the Holborn Viaduct station.&nbsp; Laurence
Sterne, fresh to the town from his Yorkshire parsonage, finding
himself in great vogue&mdash;his portrait much stared at, in
Spring Gardens, one of the four sent there, selected by Sir
Joshua as his <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>choicest works&mdash;plunged forthwith into all sorts of
frivolities, and was seen in Ranelagh more often than was
considered seemly.&nbsp; Smollett sometimes emerged from out his
Chelsea solitude for a sight of this festive world; Fielding came
here to study the scenes for his &ldquo;Amelia&rdquo;; and
Addison, too, who chats about the place in his <i>Spectator</i>.
<a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; It is spoken of in the
<i>Connoisseur</i> and the <i>Citizen of the World</i>; the poet
Bloomfield introduced it, and Fanny Burney placed here a scene in
her &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this time&mdash;just one
hundred years ago&mdash;she was a little past twenty-six, and was
living with her father, Dr. Burney, recently made organist of the
hospital chapel, next door.&nbsp; Ranelagh had then begun to
&ldquo;decline and fall off,&rdquo; in Silas Wegg&rsquo;s
immortal phrase: having been open since 1742, it was finally
closed at the beginning of this century, its artificial <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>oil-moon
paling before the rising radiance of gas-lighted new
Cremorne.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On an old tracing of the Hospital boundaries kept in its
archives, I found this inscription: &ldquo;To answer the Earl of
Ranelagh&rsquo;s house on the east side of the College, an house
was builded in the Earl of Orford&rsquo;s garden on the west
side.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the house into which Sir Robert
Walpole moved from his lodgings near by, where now Walpole Street
runs; the same lodgings in which the Earl of Sandwich had lived
long before.&nbsp; The Edward Montague, who, as Commander of the
fleet, brought Charles II. back to England, was made Earl of
Sandwich for this service, and in 1663 he came to live in
Chelsea, &ldquo;to take the ayre.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there was a
&ldquo;Mrs. Betty Becke,&rdquo; his landlady&rsquo;s daughter,
who seems to have been the real reason for this retirement, and
at whom the moral Pepys sneers as &ldquo;a slut.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
writes under date of September 9, 1663: &ldquo;I am ashamed to
see my lord so grossly play the fool, to the flinging off of all
honour, friends, and servants, and everything and <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>person that
is good, with his carrying her abroad, and playing on the lute
under her window, and forty other poor sordid things, which I am
grieved to hear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having occasion to visit his chief
here, on naval business, the Clerk of the Admiralty finds him
&ldquo;all alone, with one joynte of meat, mightily extolling the
manner of his retirement, and the goodness of his diet;&rdquo;
and was so perturbed, and so loyal withal, as to dare to write
him, &ldquo;that her wantonness occasioned much scandal, though
unjustly, to his Lordship.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was his Lordship
offended by this frankness, but remained friendly to his
Secretary.</p>
<p>Crossing through court and quadrangle and garden, to the
western side of the Hospital, we are allowed to enter its
infirmary, and to pass into ward No. 7.&nbsp; Here we stand in
Sir Robert Walpole&rsquo;s dining-room, unchanged since he left
it, except that the array of fine Italian pictures has gone from
the walls, and that decrepid soldiers lie about on cots, coughing
and drinking gruel from mugs.&nbsp; But for all this, perhaps by
reason of all this, this room, with its heavily moulded ceiling,
its stately marble mantle&mdash;in severe <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>white
throughout&mdash;is one of the most impressive relics of by-gone
grandeur in all London.&nbsp; The house, grand in its day, grand
still in its mutilation, was built by Sir John Vanbrugh, whose
architecture&mdash;florid and faulty, but with a dignity of its
own, such as strikes one in his masterpiece, Blenheim, called by
Thackeray &ldquo;a piece of splendid barbarism&rdquo;&mdash;was
as heavy as his comedies were light; and served to bring on him
Swift&rsquo;s epitaph:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lie heavy on him earth, for he<br />
Hath laid many a heavy load on thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one end&mdash;all that remains of the old red-brick
mansion&mdash;has been raised a storey, but otherwise stands
almost as when Walpole lived here from 1723 to 1746, and from its
chambers ruled England through his subjects George I. and George
II., whom he allowed to reign.&nbsp; It was from this room that
he rushed out on the arrival of the express with the news of the
death of the first George.&nbsp; He left his dinner-table at
three p.m. on the 14th June, 1727, and took horse at
once:&mdash;so riding that he &ldquo;killed two horses under
him,&rdquo; <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>says his son Horace:&mdash;and was the first to reach
the Prince of Wales at Richmond with the news.&nbsp; To Walpole
House used to drive, from her palace at Kensington, the wife of
this same Prince of Wales; who, now become George II., cheered
her solitude by writing to her long letters from his residence at
Hanover, filled with praises of his latest lady-love.&nbsp; These
epistles the fair-haired, blue-eyed, sweet-voiced woman would
bring weeping to Walpole, in search of the comfort which he
graciously gave, by assuring her that now that she was growing
old she must expect this sort of thing!&nbsp; A little later
Walpole drove from here to Kensington, and stood beside the King
at her deathbed; Caroline commending to Walpole&rsquo;s
protection her husband and his monarch!&nbsp; Here came
Bolingbroke on his return from his exile in France, to dine at
the invitation of his great rival, whom he hated and
envied.&nbsp; It was not a joyful dinner for him, and Horace
Walpole tells us that &ldquo;the first morsel he put into his
mouth was near choking him, and he was reduced to rise from the
table and leave the room for some minutes.&nbsp; I never heard of
their meeting more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Swift used <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>to stride
into dinner, studying his host for the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
Flimnap in his &ldquo;Gulliver,&rdquo; which he was then
writing.&nbsp; Here fat John Gay, then secretary or steward to
Lady Monmouth, a little farther on in Chelsea, swaggered in his
fine clothes, and being snubbed by his cynical host, put him on
the stage as &ldquo;Macheath&rdquo; in his &ldquo;Beggar&rsquo;s
Opera.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pope used to drive over in his little trap
from Twickenham, before his friend Bolingbroke&rsquo;s return, to
entertain Sir Robert with the details of his row about Lady Mary
Wortley Montague with Lord Hervey; that be-rouged fop whom he
pilloried in his rage, as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This painted child of dirt that stinks and
stings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The famous gardens, on which the gay and extravagant Lady
Walpole spent her time and money, have been built over by the
successive additions to the Infirmary; and we no longer can see
the conservatory and grotto, without which in those days no
garden was considered complete.&nbsp; The bit of ground left
serves now for the convalescent soldiers, and the graceful tree
in the centre, its branches growing horizontally out <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>from the top
of the trunk, forms a natural arbour, which they mightily enjoy
upon a sunny afternoon.&nbsp; Down at the lower end of the
garden, a bit of rotting wooden fence set above a sunken wall
marks the line of the river-bank as it ran before the building of
the embankment.&nbsp; Just here, on a pleasant terrace and in its
summer-house, that royal scamp, George IV., was fond of
philandering with his fair friends; this scene suggesting a
curious contrast with the group once surely sitting or strolling
here&mdash;a group made up of no less august personages than
Charles II. and the Earl of Sandwich with the Duchess of Mazarin,
followed by &ldquo;her adoring old friend&rdquo; St.
Evremond.&nbsp; For that lovely and luckless lady lived just
across the road, outside these grounds; and to her house in
Paradise Row I wish now to take you.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All that is now left of old Paradise Row is half a dozen small
brick cottages, with tiny gardens in front, and vines climbing
above.&nbsp; Once, when all about here was country, these
dwellings must have been really <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>delightful, and have justified the
suggestion of their name, looking out as they did on pleasant
parterres, terraced to the river.&nbsp; Unpretending as they are,
they have harboured many historic personages.&nbsp; In Paradise
Row&mdash;it is now partly Queen&rsquo;s Road West&mdash;lived
the first Duke of St. Albans, Nell Gwynne&rsquo;s son, not far
from the more modest mansion of his venerated grandmother, among
the &ldquo;neat-houses&rdquo; at Millbank.&nbsp; Her garden
sloped down to the river, and therein she fell one day, and was
drowned; and they wrote a most woeful ballad &ldquo;Upon that
never-to-be-forgotten matron, old Madame Gwynn, who died in her
own fish-pond;&rdquo; and it would seem from these ribald rhymes
that the lamented lady was fat and fond of brandy!&nbsp; This
latter weakness is also the theme of Rochester&rsquo;s muse, in
his &ldquo;Panegyric upon Nelly,&rdquo; when he commends her
scorn of cost in the funeral rites&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;To
celebrate this martyr of the ditch.<br />
Burnt Brandy did in flaming Brimmers flow,<br />
Drunk at her Fun&rsquo;ral: while her well-pleased Shade<br />
Rejoic&rsquo;d, e&rsquo;en in the sober Fields below,<br />
At all the Drunkenness her Death had made!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>In old
Paradise Row also lived the Earls of Pelham and of Sandwich, and
the Duchess of Hamilton.&nbsp; At the corner of Robinson&rsquo;s
Lane&mdash;now Flood Street&mdash;stood Lord Robarte&rsquo;s
house, wherein he gave the famous supper to Charles II. on the
4th of September, 1660, and was soon after made Earl of Radnor:
whence the street of that name hard by.&nbsp; On April 19, 1665,
Pepys visited him here, and &ldquo;found it to <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>be the
prettiest contrived house that ever I saw in my
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; It stood there until within a few weeks, a
venerable tavern known as &ldquo;The Duke&rsquo;s Head&rdquo;:
now gone the way of so much historic brick and mortar!&nbsp;
Latest of all our Chelsea celebrities, Faulkner, the historian of
Chelsea, lived on the corner of Paradise Row, and what was then
Ormond Row, now commonplace Smith Street.&nbsp; A quiet, quaint
old public-house, &ldquo;The Chelsea Pensioner,&rdquo; stands
where Faulkner worked with such pains, on his driest of records;
yet to them we are all glad to go for many of our facts about
modern Chelsea.&nbsp; These poor little plaster-fronted cottages,
stretching from this corner to Christchurch Street, now represent
the once stately Ormond Row; and the swinging sign of the
&ldquo;Ormond Dairy&rdquo; is all we have to commemorate old
Ormond House, which stood just here.&nbsp; In its gardens,
sloping to the river bank, Walpole&rsquo;s later house was built,
as we have seen it to-day.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Let us stop again before the little two-storied house, the
easternmost of Paradise Row, standing discreetly back from the
street behind a prim plot of <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>grass; well-wrought-iron gates are
swung on square gate-posts, a-top of each of which is an
old-fashioned stone globe, of the sort seldom seen
nowadays.&nbsp; A queer little sounding-board projects over the
small door; and above the little windows we read &ldquo;School of
Discipline, Instituted <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1825.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the oldest school of the kind in London,
was founded by Elizabeth Fry, and in it young girls, forty-two at
a time, each staying two years, &ldquo;are reformed for five
shillings a week,&rdquo; and fitted for domestic service.&nbsp;
They wear very queer aprons, their hair is plastered properly,
their shoes are clumsy; and no queerer contrast was ever imagined
than that between them and the perfumed, curled, high-heeled
dame, who once lived here.&nbsp; She is well worth looking back
at, as we sit here in her low-ceilinged drawing-room, darkly
panelled, as are hall and staircase by which we have passed in
entering.</p>
<p>Hortensia Mancini, the daughter of Cardinal Mazarin&rsquo;s
sister, had been married while very young to some Duke, who was
allowed to assume the name of Mazarin on his marriage.&nbsp; A
religious fanatic, he <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>soon shut her up in a convent, from
which she took her flight and found her way to England in
boy&rsquo;s costume.&nbsp; There, as the handsomest woman in
Europe, her coming caused commotion among her rivals, all
remembering the flutter she had excited in Charles II. during his
exile in France.&nbsp; Ruvigny <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a> writes: &ldquo;She
has entered the English court as Armida entered the camp of
Godfrey.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, this one soon showed that she, too,
was a sorceress; and Rochester, in his famous
&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; acclaims her the &ldquo;renowned
Mazarine, first in the glorious Roll of Infamy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Living luxuriously and lavishly for a while, until by the death
of her royal lover she lost her pension of &pound;4000 yearly,
she came at length to this little house as her last
dwelling-place; and even here, reduced to real poverty, unable to
pay her butcher or her baker, written down on the Parish books of
1695, &ldquo;A Defaulter of the Parish Rates:&rdquo; she yet
persisted in giving grand dinners&mdash;the cost of <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>which (so old
Lysons heard) was met by each guest leaving monies under his
napkin!&nbsp; For all that, this modest mansion was the favourite
resort of famous men of her day; who lounged in of an evening to
discuss and speculate, to play at her basset-tables, to listen to
her music, mostly dramatic, the forerunner of Italian opera in
this country.&nbsp; Here came Sydney Godolphin, that rare man who
was &ldquo;never in the way, and yet never out of the way;&rdquo;
here the king was frequently found; here Saint Evremond was
always found!&nbsp; How real to us is the figure of this gallant
old Frenchman, as we see him in the National Portrait Gallery:
his white hair flowing below his black cap; his large forehead;
his dark blue eyes; the great wen that grew in his later years
between them, just at the top of his nose: a shrewd, kindly,
epicurean face.&nbsp; He came of a noble Norman family from Denis
le Guast, this Charles de Saint Denys, Seigneur de Saint
Evremond.&nbsp; Entering the army at an early age, he rose
rapidly to a captaincy; his bravery and his wit&mdash;a little
less than that of Voltaire, whom he helped to form, says
Hallam&mdash;making him <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the friend of Turenne, of the great
Cond&egrave;, and of others of that brilliant band.&nbsp;
Satirizing Mazarin, he was locked in the Bastille for three
months; and when free, he finally fled from the cardinal&rsquo;s
fury, and came to England: here to end his days, waiting on this
still fascinating woman, worshipping her, advising her, writing
plays for her, and poetry to her.&nbsp; He held the rank of
Governor of Duck Island, in the ornamental water of St.
James&rsquo;s Park&mdash;an office invented for him by Charles
II., and having a fine title, a large salary, and no
duties.&nbsp; You may throw bread to-day to the lineal
descendants of those ducks of which the King was so fond.&nbsp;
Saint Evremond died in 1703, and lies in the Poet&rsquo;s Corner
of Westminster Abbey, near to Chaucer and Beaumont and Dryden;
his adored lady having died in 1699 in this very house.&nbsp; She
was not buried; for after all these years of self-effacement her
devoted husband again appears, has her body embalmed, and carries
it with him wherever he journeys.</p>
<p>Mary Astell lived and died in her little house in Paradise
Row; a near neighbour of, and a curious <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>contrast to,
the Duchess of Mazarin, whom she pointed at in her writings as a
warning of the doom decreed to beauty and to wit, when shackled
in slavery to Man, and so dis-weaponed in the fight against fate
and forgetfulness.&nbsp; <i>She</i> devoted herself to celibacy
and &ldquo;to the propagation of virtue,&rdquo; as Smollett slily
put it.&nbsp; Congreve satirized her, too; Swift stained her with
his sneers as &ldquo;Madonella;&rdquo; Addison and Steele made
fun of her in their gentler way.&nbsp; Doubtless there was
something of <i>la Pr&eacute;cieuse Ridicule</i> to that
generation in the aspect of this most learned lady, who wrote
pamphlets and essays; in which, following More&rsquo;s lead, she
urged the higher education of her sex; and preached as well as
practised persistent protests against the folly of those pretty
women, &ldquo;who think more of their glasses than of their
reflections.&rdquo;&nbsp; She inveighed much&mdash;this in our
modern manner&mdash;against marriage, and woman&rsquo;s devotion
to man; putting it with point and pith, that Woman owes a duty to
Man &ldquo;only by the way, just as it may be any man&rsquo;s
duty to keep hogs; he was not made for this, but if he hires <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>himself out
for this employment, he is bound to perform it
conscientiously.&rdquo;&nbsp; One good work of hers still
survives.&nbsp; Failing to found among her female friends a
College or Community for Celibacy and Study, she induced Lady
Elizabeth Hastings&mdash;her immortalized as the Aspasia of the
<i>Tatler</i> by Congreve and by Steele, and to whom the latter
applied his exquisite words, &ldquo;to love her is a liberal
education&rdquo;&mdash;and other noble ladies to endow in 1729 a
school for the daughters of old pensioners of the Royal Hospital;
and this little child&rsquo;s charity was the precursor and
harbinger of the present grand asylum at Hampstead, which
clothes, educates, and cares for these girls.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is but a step to the spacious, many-windowed brick building
in the King&rsquo;s Road; on the pediment of which, in Cheltenham
Terrace, we read: &ldquo;The Royal Military Asylum for the
Children of Soldiers of the Regular Army.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
popularly known as the &ldquo;Duke of York&rsquo;s School,&rdquo;
and is devoted to the <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>training of the orphan boys of poor
soldiers.&nbsp; It is a pleasant sight to watch them going
through their man&oelig;uvres in their gravel ground; or, off
duty, playing football and leap-frog.&nbsp; They bear themselves
right martially in their red jackets and queer caps, a few
proudly carrying their corporal&rsquo;s yellow chevrons, a fewer
still prouder of their &ldquo;good conduct stripes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was &ldquo;B 65,&rdquo; big with the double dignity of both
badges of honour, who unbent to my questioning; and explained
that the lads are entered at the age of ten, can remain until
fourteen, can then become drummers if fitted for that vocation,
or can give up their army career and take their chances in
civilians&rsquo; pursuits.</p>
<p>We may not pause long before the iron gates which let us look
in on the mansion named Blacklands; now a private mad-house, and
the only remnant of the great estate once owned by Lord Cheyne,
and which covered more than the extent of Sloane Street and
Square, Cadogan and Hans Place: all these laid out and built by
Holland in 1777, and by him called Hans Town.&nbsp; We might have
stopped, a while ago, in front of the vast Chelsea barracks, just
to the <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>south, to look at the faded plaster-fronted shop,
opposite.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Old Chelsea Bun-House,&rdquo; its sign
assured us it was, before its demolition last year; yet it was
only the descendant of the original house, which stood a little
farther east up Pimlico Road, formerly Jews&rsquo; Road.&nbsp;
That once mal-odorous street is yet fragrant with the buns baked
there in the last century, when the little shop was crowded with
dainty damsels in hoops and furbelows, with gallants in wigs and
three-cornered hats, while stately flunkies strode in the street
below.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, are not the fine buns sold here in our
town as the rare Chelsea buns?&nbsp; I bought one to-day in my
walk&rdquo;&mdash;Swift tells Stella in his journal for
1712.&nbsp; Half-mad George III. and Queen Charlotte&mdash;she
popularly known as &ldquo;Old Snuffy&rdquo;&mdash;were fond of
driving out to Chelsea Bun-House, to sit on its verandah munching
buns, much stared at by the curious crowd.&nbsp; The old building
was torn down in 1839, &ldquo;to the general regret in London and
its environs,&rdquo; its crazy collection of poor pictures, bogus
antiques, and genuine Chelsea ware being sold by auction; all of
which is duly chronicled in &ldquo;The <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and
Instruction&rdquo; of April 6, 1839.</p>
<p>Turning back again to Paradise Row, we glance across the road
at a great square mansion standing in spacious grounds, used as
the Victoria Hospital for Children, a beneficent
institution.&nbsp; This is Gough House, built by that profane
Earl of Carberry, who diced and drank and dallied in company with
Buckingham and Rochester and Sedley.&nbsp; Early in the last
century it came into possession of Sir John Gough, whence the
name it still retains.&nbsp; Nearly two centuries of odd doings
and of queer social history tenant these walls; but we can pause
no longer than to glance at the little cots standing against the
ancient wainscotting of the stately rooms, and the infant
patients toddling up the massive oak staircases.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>We turn the corner, and pass through Tite Street, and so come,
in refreshing contrast with its ambitious artificiality, to a bit
of genuine nature&mdash;a great garden stretching from Swan Walk
and the Queen&rsquo;s Road, and fronting just here on the
Embankment.&nbsp; On one of the great stone posts of this
entrance&mdash;once the water-gate&mdash;<a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>we read:
&ldquo;The Botanic Garden of the Society of Apothecaries of
London, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1673;&rdquo; on the
other: &ldquo;Granted to the Society in Perpetuity by Sir Hans
Sloane, Bart., <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1723.&rdquo;&nbsp; These grounds remain intact as when in this
last-named year four acres of Lord Cheyne&rsquo;s former domain
were made over to the Society of Apothecaries for &ldquo;The
Chelsea Physick Garden;&rdquo; with permission to build thereon a
barge-house and offices, for their convenience when they came up
the river.&nbsp; The buildings were demolished in 1853, but the
gardens have bravely held out against the Vandal hordes of
bricklayers and builders; and in them all the herbs of Materia
Medica which can grow in the open air are cultivated to this very
day for the instruction of medical students, just as when Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s Polyphilus&mdash;the universal genius of the
<i>Rambler</i>&mdash;started to come out here from London streets
to see a new plant in flower.&nbsp; The trees are no longer so
vigorous as when Evelyn, so fond of fine trees, praised them; and
of the twelve noble Cedars of Lebanon planted by the hand of Sir
Hans, but one still stands; and this one, even in its
decrepitude, is nearly as notable, it seems to me, as <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>that
glorious unequalled one in the private garden of Monseigneur the
Archbishop of Tours.&nbsp; In the centre stands the statue of Sir
Hans Sloane, put up in 1733, chipped and stained by wind and
weather.&nbsp; For, in this garden Hans Sloane studied, and when
he became rich and famous and bought the manor of Chelsea, he
gave the freehold of this place to the Apothecaries&rsquo;
Company on condition that it should be devoted for ever to the
use of all students of nature.</p>
<p>Westward a little way, we come to &ldquo;Swan
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; This modern-antique mansion stands on the
site of, and gets its name from, the &ldquo;Old Swan
Tavern,&rdquo; which has been gone these fifteen years now, and
which stood right over the river, with projecting wooden
balconies, and a land entrance from Queen&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; It
and its predecessor&mdash;a little lower down the
river&mdash;were historic public-houses resorted to by parties
pleasuring from town; and this was always a house of call for
watermen with their wherries, as we find so well pictured in
Marryat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jacob Faithful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Pepys
turned back on the 9th of April, 1666; having come out for a
holiday, and &ldquo;thinking to have been <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>merry at
Chelsey; but being come almost to the house by coach near the
waterside, a house alone, I think the Swan,&rdquo; he learned
from a passer-by that the plague had broken out in this suburb,
and that the &ldquo;house was shut up of the sickness.&nbsp; So
we with great affright . . . went away for
Kensington.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old fellow&mdash;he was young
then&mdash;was fond of taking boat or coach, &ldquo;to be merry
at Chelsey&rdquo;; often with Mrs. Knipp, the pretty actress;
sometimes with both her and his wife, and then he drily complains
to his diary&mdash;&ldquo;and my wife out of humour, as she
always is when this woman is by.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the critics
claim that he had no sense of fun!&nbsp; Until the &ldquo;Old
Swan&rdquo; was torn down, it served as the goal for the annual
race which is still rowed on the first day of every August from
the &ldquo;Old Swan Tavern&rdquo; at London Bridge, by the young
Thames watermen, for the prize instituted in 1715 by
Doggett&mdash;that fine low comedian of Queen Anne&rsquo;s day: a
silver medal stamped with the white horse of Hanover (in
commemoration of the First George&rsquo;s coronation), and a
waterman&rsquo;s orange-coloured coat full of pockets, each
pocket holding a golden guinea.</p>

<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Just
beyond, at Flood Street, begins Cheyne Walk; still, despite
almost daily despoiling, despite embankments and gas and cabs,
the most old-fashioned, dignified, and impressive spot in all
London.&nbsp; Those of its modest brick houses which remain have
not been ruined by too many modern improvements; they are prim
and respectable, clad in a sedate secluded sobriety, not at all
of this day.&nbsp; Their little front gardens are unpretending
and almost sad.&nbsp; Between them and the street are fine
specimens of old wrought iron in railings and in gates, in last
century brackets for lamps, in iron extinguishers for the links
they used to carry.&nbsp; The name &ldquo;Hans Sloane
House&rdquo; is wrought in open iron letters, in the gate of No.
17; in others, the numbers alone are thus worked in the antique
pattern.&nbsp; &ldquo;Manor House&rdquo; has an attractive old
plaster front; on another a shining brass plate, dimly marked
&ldquo;Gothic House&rdquo; in well-worn letters, is just what we
want to find there.&nbsp; In No. 4 died, on the night of the 22nd
December, 1880, Mrs. John Walter Cross, more widely known as
George Eliot.&nbsp; And in this same house lived for many years
Daniel Maclise, the painter of the two <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>grandest
national pictures yet produced in England; &ldquo;the gentlest
and most modest of men,&rdquo; said his friend Charles
Dickens.&nbsp; Here he died on the 25th of April, 1870, and from
here he was carried to Kensal Green.</p>

<p>In No. 15 lived for a long time that youthful genius, Cecil
Lawson; whose admirable works, rejected at one time by the Royal
Academy, have been hung in places of honour, since.&nbsp; One
would be glad to have stepped from his studio into that next
door, No. 16, and to have seen Dante Gabriel Rossetti at work
there. <a name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a>&nbsp; His house&mdash;now again known
by its ancient and proper title, &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
House&rdquo;&mdash;stands back between court and garden, its
stately double front bowed out by a spacious central bay, the
famous drawing-room on the first floor taking the whole
width.&nbsp; This great bay, as high as the house, is not so old,
however; and must be an addition of more recent years; for the
house itself plainly dates from the days of the <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Stuarts.&nbsp; Indeed, it shows the influence, if not
the very hand, of the admirable Wren; not only in the external
architecture, but in the perfect proportion to all its parts of
the panelling, the windows, the doorways within.&nbsp; All the
hall-ways and the rooms, even to the kitchen, are heavily
wainscotted; and there mounts, up through the whole height of the
interior, a spiral staircase, its balustrade of finest
hand-wrought iron.&nbsp; So, too, are the railings and the
gateway of the <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>front courtyard, as you see them in our sketch; and,
while much of their dainty detail has been gnawed away by the
tooth of time, they still show the skill, the patience, and the
conscience of the workers of that earlier day.&nbsp; The iron
crown which once topped this gate has long since been taken away;
but we may still trace in twisted iron the initials &ldquo;C.
R.,&rdquo; and we may still see these same initials in larger
iron lettering within the pattern of the back-garden
railings.&nbsp; Catherine of Braganza, Queen of England, is the
name they are believed to commemorate; and legend says that this
house was once tenanted by, and perhaps built for, that
long-suffering consort of Charles II.&nbsp; I like to fancy her
within these walls&mdash;the brilliant brunette stepping down
from Lely&rsquo;s canvas at Hampton Court or at Versailles; whose
superb black eyes were celebrated by the court poet, Edmund
Waller, in an ode on her birthday, and were characterized by
sedate John Evelyn as &ldquo;languishing and excellent&rdquo;;
and who was pronounced to be &ldquo;mighty pretty&rdquo; by that
erudite and studious critic of female beauty, Samuel Pepys.&nbsp;
She wears the black velvet <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>costume so becoming to her, and
divides her days between pious rites and frisky
dances&mdash;devoted equally to both!&nbsp; A narrow, bigoted,
good woman, this: yet, withal, simple, confiding, affectionate,
modest, patient under neglect from her husband, and under insult
from his mistresses; deserving a little longer devotion than the
six weeks Charles vouchsafed to her after their marriage, never
deserving the lampoons with which Andrew Marvel befouled her.</p>

<p>When this front courtyard of &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s House&rdquo;
happened to be dug up, not long ago, three sorts of bricks were
unearthed: those of modern make, those of the Stuart time, those
of the Tudor type.&nbsp; These latter were the same narrow flat
ones spoken of as being found in More&rsquo;s chapel and wall;
and were evidently the wreckage of the water-gate once standing
here, giving entrance, together with the water stairway, from the
river&mdash;running close alongside then&mdash;to the palace of
Henry VIII.&nbsp; And in the foundations of &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
House&rdquo; are to be seen remains of that Tudor stone-work;
while, in the cellars of the adjacent houses are heavy
nail-studded doors <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>and windows, and similar survivals of that old
Palace.&nbsp; It was built just here by the King, who had learned
to like Chelsea, in his visits to More.&nbsp; He had bartered
land elsewhere&mdash;presumably stolen by him&mdash;for the old
Manor House standing farther west, near the Church, which
belonged to the Lawrence family.&nbsp; That not suiting him, he
built this new Manor House&mdash;a little back from the river
bank, and a little east of where Oakley Street now runs&mdash;its
gardens reaching nearly to the present Flood Street, Manor Street
having been cut through their midst.&nbsp; It was of brick, its
front and its gateway much like that of St. James&rsquo;s Palace,
as it looks up St. James&rsquo;s Street; that built just before
this, by Wolsey, and &ldquo;conveyed&rdquo; to himself by the
King.&nbsp; An old document describes the Manor House, as the
&ldquo;said capital messuage, containing on the first floor, 3
cellars, 3 halls, 3 kitchens, 3 parlours, 9 other rooms and
larders; on the second floor, 3 drawing rooms and 17 chambers,
and above, Summer-rooms, closets and garrets; 1 stable and 1
coach-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; That seems not so very grand in the
eyes of our modern magnificence.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>I
have been able to trace the great grounds of the palace, covered
in part with streets and houses as they now are, and in part
forming the rear gardens of this end of Cheyne Walk.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in these gardens are still standing here and there remnants
of the ancient encircling walls.&nbsp; The fine garden of
Queen&rsquo;s House was originally a portion of the palace
grounds, and stood intact even to Rossetti&rsquo;s time;
something of its <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>extent then being shown in our sketch.&nbsp; The noble
lime trees still stand there, and among them two strange exotic
trees, their leaves unknown to the local gardeners.&nbsp; This
garden is now partly built on by new mansions, partly usurped by
their gardens.&nbsp; In two of the latter&mdash;spreading out
into both&mdash;stands the mulberry tree planted by the hand of
the Princess Elizabeth, still sturdy in its hale old age.&nbsp;
At the back of other houses a little farther west, notably in the
garden of Mr. Druse, stand some very ancient trees; and I saw
there, not very long ago&mdash;but gone, for ever now&mdash;a bit
of crumbling wall, and an arch, within which were the old hinges
whereon a gate was once hung.&nbsp; That gate gave entrance from
the land side, by a path leading across the fields from the
King&rsquo;s Road, to the palace grounds; and through it, Seymour
slipped on his secret visits to Katherine Parr, as we know by a
letter of hers: &ldquo;I pray you let me have knowledge over
night, at what hour ye will come, that your portress may wait at
the gate to the fields for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she and Seymour
had their historic romps under these very trees with the <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Princess
Elizabeth, then a girl of thirteen.&nbsp; Within doors, too,
there were strange pranks &ldquo;betwixt the Lord Admiral, and
the Lady Elizabeth&rsquo;s Grace,&rdquo; as was later confessed
by Katherine Aschyly, her maid.&nbsp; When the young lady learned
that Miss Aschyly and Her Cofferer were under examination in the
Tower, says the old chronicler, &ldquo;She was marvelous
abashede, and ded weype very tenderly a long Time, demandyng of
my Lady Browne wether they had confessed anything!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Katherine Parr did not enjoy these frolics, and sometimes was
furious with jealousy on finding them out; but for all that, she
patiently returned to her persistent pious writing, too kindly a
nature to harbour malice or suspicion.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had come to live in the Manor House, at the age of
four, that she might grow up in that healthful air: her father
placing, with his customary delicacy, the daughter of Anne Boleyn
under the care and tuition and example of his latest wife, the
staid and studious Katherine Parr.&nbsp; To this latter, the King
had given, on their marriage, the Manor House as her jointure;
and there she lived in great state, <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>after Henry&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;
Already before their marriage, even then a wistful widow, she had
been bewitched by Seymour; and had meant to marry him, but for
being forced to submit to the King&rsquo;s will to make her his
queen.&nbsp; Once queen, she seemed to subdue her passion for
Seymour; says the na&iuml;ve ancient chronicler, &ldquo;it does
not appear that any interruption to connubial comforts arose out
of that particular source.&rdquo;&nbsp; The estimable monarch
rotted to death at the end of January, 1546&ndash;7, and the
month of May was made merry to his widow&mdash;but thirty-five
years old&mdash;by her secret marriage with Seymour.&nbsp; He was
a turbulent, unscrupulous, handsome rascal, a greedy gambler, an
insane intriguer; brother of the Protector Somerset, maternal
uncle of King Edward VII., brother-in-law of the King; and he had
tried to marry the Princess Elizabeth, then a girl of thirteen or
fourteen, even while coquetting with the Queen-Dowager Katherine
Parr.&nbsp; The girl with her Boleyn blood doubtless delighted in
the mystery of the secret visits, which she knew of, and in the
secret marriage later, which she surely suspected.&nbsp; The
Queen-Dowager <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>must have found it a trying and turbulent task to train
her, and had more comfort in her other pupil, little Lady Jane
Grey; who came here often for a visit, and for sympathy in the
studies in which she was already a prodigy, even then at the age
of eleven.&nbsp; She is a pure and perfect picture, this lovely
and gentle girl, amid all these cruel and crafty creatures; but
we cannot follow her farther in the touching tragedy, in which
she played the innocent usurper, the blameless martyr.&nbsp; Nor
can we say more of Katherine Parr&mdash;probably poisoned by her
husband&mdash;nor of his death on the block, nor of the rascally
and wretched record of the future owners of this Manor House; but
let us come directly down to the year 1712, when it was sold by
Lord William Cheyne, lord of the manor, widely known as
&ldquo;Lady Jane&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; to Sir Hans
Sloane.&nbsp; It was looked on then as a grand place, and Evelyn,
visiting Lord Cheyne and Lady Jane, notes in his diary that the
gardens are fine, the fountains &ldquo;very surprising and
extraordinary.&rdquo;&nbsp; These had been designed by
Winstanley, him who built Eddystone Lighthouse, and who perished
therein.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Hans
Sloane had come up to London, a young Irish student of medicine;
and, frequenting the Botanical Gardens in Chelsea, just in view
of this Manor House, he must often have looked at and perhaps
longed to live in the roomy old mansion.&nbsp; After his return
from Jamaica, he pursued his studies with such success that he
was made President of the Royal Society on the death of Sir Isaac
Newton, in 1727.&nbsp; He became a famous physician, was doctor
to the Queens Anne and Caroline, as well as to George I., who
made him a baronet in 1716; the first physician so ennobled in
England.&nbsp; As he grew in wealth he bought much property in
Chelsea, first this Manor House&mdash;wherein he lived for
fourteen years, and wherein he died&mdash;then More&rsquo;s
house, then land in other quarters of this suburb.&nbsp; His name
is perpetuated in Sloane Square and in Hans Place, and his
property now forms the estate of the Earl of Cadogan, whose
ancestor, the famous General Cadogan, a Colonel of the Horse
Guards in Marlborough&rsquo;s <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>wars, married Elizabeth, daughter
and co-heiress of Sir Hans Sloane; so that the present Earl of
Cadogan is &ldquo;Lord of the Manor and Viscount
Chelsey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But greater than his riches, better than all his other
services, is the fact that Sir Hans Sloane was the founder of the
British Museum.&nbsp; The extraordinary collection in Natural
History, of books and of manuscripts, with which his house in
Bloomsbury was filled, and which then overflowed into his Chelsea
house, was left by him to the Nation, on the payment to his
estate of only &pound;20,000; it having cost him not less than
&pound;50,000.&nbsp; Parliament passed the appropriation, the
purchase was perfected, and this little pond has now grown into
the great ocean of the British Museum; on the shores of which, we
who come to scoop up our small spoonfuls of knowledge are cared
for so courteously by its guardians.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There was an Irish servant of Sir Hans Sloane, one Salter, who
established himself in 1695 as a barber in a little house in
Cheyne Walk which stood on the site of <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the present
Nos. 17 and 18: &ldquo;six doors beyond Manor Street,&rdquo;
contemporary papers say, and I have no doubt this is the correct
site.&nbsp; Salter was a thin little man, with a hungry look as
of one fond of philosophy or of fretting; and Vice-Admiral
Munden, just home from years of service on the Spanish coast,
dubbed him, in a freak, Don Saltero, a title he carried to his
death.&nbsp; He took in all the papers, and had musical
instruments lying about&mdash;he himself twanged Don-like the
guitar&mdash;that his customers might divert themselves while
awaiting their turns.&nbsp; His master had given him a lot of
rubbish, for which his own house had no more room, as well as
duplicates of curiosities of real value in the Museum in
Bloomsbury.&nbsp; To these he added others of his own invention:
the inevitable bit of the Holy Cross, the pillar to which Jesus
was tied when scourged, a necklace of Job&rsquo;s tears; and, as
the little barber rhymed in his advertisements in 1723, just
after De Foe had set the town talking with his new
book&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Monsters of all sorts here are seen,<br />
Strange things in Nature as they grew so;<br />
Some relics of the Sheba Queen,<br />
And fragments of the famed Bob Crusoe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>So
that &ldquo;my eye was diverted by ten thousand gimcracks on the
walls and ceiling,&rdquo; as Steele puts it in the <i>Tatler</i>,
describing a Voyage to Chelsea.&nbsp; For Don Saltero&rsquo;s
museum, barber&rsquo;s shop, reading-room, coffee-house had
become quite the vogue, and a favourite lounge for men of
quality.&nbsp; Old St. Evremond was probably among the first to
be shaved here; Richard Cromwell used to come often and sit
silently&mdash;&ldquo;a little, and very neat old man, with a
most placid countenance, the effect of his innocent and
unambitious life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Steele and Addison and their
friends were frequent visitors &ldquo;to the Coffee House where
the Literati sit in council.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there came here one
day about 1724 or 1725, a young man of eighteen or twenty years,
out for a holiday from the printing-press at which he worked in
Bartholomew Close&mdash;Benjamin Franklin by name, recently
arrived from the loyal Colonies of North America, and lodging in
Little Britain.&nbsp; He had brought with him to London a purse
of asbestos, which Sir Hans Sloane, hearing of, bought at a
handsome price, and added to his museum.&nbsp; To this museum he
gave the young printer an invitation, and probably told <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>him about
Don Saltero&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was on Franklin&rsquo;s return from
there&mdash;the party went by river, of course&mdash;that he
undressed and leapt into the water, and, as he wrote in his
letters, &ldquo;swam from near Chelsea the whole way to
Blackfriars Bridge, exhibiting during the course a variety of
feats of activity and address, both upon the surface of the
water, as well as under it.&nbsp; This sight occasioned much
astonishment and pleasure to those to whom it was new.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>It is a far cry from Dick Steele to Charles Lamb, yet the
latter too makes mention of the &ldquo;Don Saltero Tavern&rdquo;
in one of his letters; saying that he had had offered to him, by
a fellow clerk in the India House, all the ornaments of its
smoking-room, at the time of the auction-sale, when the
collection was dispersed.</p>
<p>This was in 1807, and the place was then turned into a tavern;
its original sign&mdash;&ldquo;Don Saltero&rsquo;s, 1695,&rdquo;
in gold letters on a green board&mdash;swinging between beams in
front, until the demolition of the old house only twenty years
ago. <a name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>A
little farther on, just west of Oakley Street, on the outer edge
of the roadway of Cheyne Walk, stood, until within a few months,
another old sign, at which I was wont to look in delight,
unshamed by the mute mockery of the passing Briton, who wondered
what the sentimental prowler could see to attract him in this
rusty relic.&nbsp; It stood in front of the little public-house
lately burned to the ground&mdash;&ldquo;The Magpie and
Stump:&rdquo; two solid posts carrying a wide cross-piece, all
bristling with spikes for the impalement of the climbing boy of
the period; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Magpie and Stump, Quoit
Grounds</span>,&rdquo; in dingy letters on the outer side, once
plain for all rowing men to read from the river; above was an
iron Magpie on an iron Stump, both decrepid with age, and a rusty
old weathercock, too stiff to turn even the letter
<i>E</i>&mdash;<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>alone left of the four points of the compass.&nbsp;
Between these posts might still be traced the top stone of an old
water-staircase, embedded now in the new-made ground which forms
the embankment garden here; just as you might have seen, only the
other day, the water-stairs of Whitehall Palace, which have now
been carted away.&nbsp; Up this staircase Queen Elizabeth has
often stepped, on her frequent visits to the rich and powerful
Earl of Shrewsbury, her devoted subject and friend.&nbsp; For, on
the river slope, just back of Cheyne Walk here, stood, until the
second decade of this century, Shrewsbury House, another one of
Chelsea&rsquo;s grand mansions.&nbsp; It was an irregular brick
structure, much gabled, built about a quadrangle; although but
one storey in height it was sufficiently spacious, its great room
being one hundred and twenty feet in length, wainscotted in
finely carved oak, and its oratory painted to resemble
marble.&nbsp; In a circular room there was concealed a trap-door,
giving entrance to a winding stairway, which led to an
underground passage; believed to have opened on the river wall at
low tide, and to have twisted inland to the &ldquo;Black
Horse&rdquo; <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>in Chelsea, and thence to Holland House,
Kensington.&nbsp; Local gossip claims that it was used by the
Jacobites of 1745, and perhaps of 1715, too; for they made their
rendezvous by the river at this tavern, and here drank to their
&ldquo;King over the water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the grounds of the
&ldquo;Magpie and Stump&rdquo; is a wooden trapdoor, through
which I once descended by stone steps into a paved stone passage,
sufficiently wide and high for two to pass, standing erect.&nbsp;
This bit is all that remains of the old tunnel&mdash;the river
portion being used as a coal-hole, the inland end soon stopped up
and lost in neighbouring cellars.</p>

<p>The wife of this Earl of Shrewsbury is well worth our
attention for a moment, by reason of her beauty, her character,
her romantic career, her many marriages.&nbsp; Elizabeth Hardwick
of Derby became Mrs. Barley at the age of fourteen, and was a
wealthy widow when only sixteen; she soon married Sir William
Cavendish, ancestor of the Duke of Devonshire; to be widowed soon
again, and soon to become the wife of Sir William St. Loo,
Captain of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Guard.&nbsp; His death left
her still so lovely, witty, attractive, as to <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>captivate
the greatest subject in the land; and she became the Countess of
Shrewsbury; having risen regularly in riches, position, power,
with each of her marriages.&nbsp; After the death of her fourth
husband she consented to remain a widow.&nbsp; At her death,
seventeen years later, she bequeathed this Chelsea mansion to her
son William, afterward the first Duke of Devonshire; together
with the three grandest seats in England&mdash;Hardwick,
Oldcoates, Chatsworth&mdash;all builded by her at successive
stages of her eventful career.</p>
<p>Hard by here we trace the site of another notable
mansion&mdash;the ancient palace of the Bishops of
Winchester&mdash;which stood a little back from the river bank,
just where broad Oakley Street runs up from opposite the Albert
Suspension Bridge.&nbsp; It was only two storeys high and of
humble exterior, yet it contained many grand rooms, lavishly
decorated.&nbsp; On the wall of one of the chambers, there was
found, when the building was torn down early in the century, a
group of nine life-size figures, admirably done in black on the
white plaster; believed to have been drawn by Hogarth in one of
his visits to his friend Bishop Hoadley, here.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>A
step farther westward along Cheyne Walk and we turn into Lawrence
Street; at the upper end of which, at the corner of Justice Walk,
we shall find, in the cellars of &ldquo;The Prince of
Wales&rdquo; tavern and of the adjoining houses, the remains of
the ovens and baking-rooms of the famous Chelsea China
factory.&nbsp; For it stood just here during the short forty
years of its existence, having been established in 1745.&nbsp;
Why it failed and why the factory was torn down, no one seems to
know; for its work was extremely fine, and its best
ware&mdash;turned out from 1750 to 1765&mdash;was equal to that
of S&egrave;vres.&nbsp; Skilled foreign artizans had been brought
over, and an extraordinary specimen of unskilled native workman
appeared in Dr. Samuel Johnson.&nbsp; The old scholar conceived
the idea that he could make china as admirably as he could make a
dictionary; but he never mastered the secret of mixing, and each
piece of his cracked in the baking!&nbsp; He used to come out
here twice a week, his old housekeeper carrying his basket of
food for the day; and was made free of the whole factory, except
the mixing-room.&nbsp; They presented him with a full service of
their own <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>make, properly baked, however; which he gave or
bequeathed to Mrs. Piozzo, and which, at the sale of her effects,
was bought by Lord Holland.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Holland House by
Kensington&rdquo;&mdash;to use its good old title&mdash;I have
seen it, carefully preserved among the other famed
<i>curios</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Danvers Street, begun in ye Yeare 1696,&rdquo;
says the quaint old lettering in a corner house of Cheyne Walk;
and this street marks the site of Danvers House, which had formed
part of More&rsquo;s property&mdash;perhaps the &ldquo;new
buildinge&rdquo;&mdash;and which had gone to his son-in-law,
Roper.&nbsp; It came afterward to be owned <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>by Sir John
Danvers, a gentleman-usher of Charles I., and he made a superb
place of it; of which the deep foundations and the fallen columns
now lie under Paultons Square, at the upper end of the
street.&nbsp; Sir John Danvers was the second husband of Magdalen
Herbert, a woman notable for her famous family of boys: her first
son was that strong and strange original, Lord Herbert of
Cherbury; her fifth son was George Herbert, of undying
memory.&nbsp; The poet lived here for a while.&nbsp; Donne, the
preacher, then at Oxford, used to stop at her house on his visits
to London; and when he became Vicar of St.
Dunstan&rsquo;s-in-the-West, in the Strand, near Isaac
Walton&rsquo;s old shop in Chancery Lane, and had converted the
Gentle Angler, these two certainly strolled often out here
together.&nbsp; Donne preached Lady Danvers&rsquo; funeral sermon
in Old Chelsea Church in 1627; notable as one of his most
touching discourses.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the embankment gardens we have passed a statue recently
placed there; a man seated in a chair, uncouth <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of figure,
with bent brow and rugged face.&nbsp; And in the wall of the
corner house behind we stop to look at a small memorial tablet,
still more recently placed; a medallion portrait of the same
face, and beneath, this inscription: &ldquo;Thomas Carlyle lived
at 24, Cheyne Row, 1834&ndash;81.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this is not
the house in which he lived, and the tablet was fixed on this one
with queer common sense, his own being in Chancery at that
time!&nbsp; It is to be found farther up in this little dull
street running from Cheyne Walk just here; in which there is
nothing that is not commonplace, save the little cottage covered
with vines, in the wall above which is a stone with odd
old-fashioned lettering&mdash;&ldquo;This is Gt. Cheyne Row,
1708.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the middle of the row of small dreary
brick houses, the one once numbered 5, now 24, is that in which
he dwelt for nearly fifty years, and wherein he wrote his
commination service large on all mankind; talking more
eloquently, and more loquaciously withal, in praise of silence,
than any man who ever scolded all through life that he might do
honour to the strong arm and the still tongue!</p>

<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>The
look-out across the narrow street from his front
windows&mdash;&ldquo;mainly into trees,&rdquo; he wrote to Sir
William Hamilton, on moving here&mdash;shows now nothing but a
long, low, depressing wall, above which rises a many-windowed
model dwelling-house; and it is surely one of the least inspiring
prospects in all London: while from the back he could see nothing
of interest except the westernmost end of the old wall of Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s Manor House garden, which still stands here.&nbsp;
It gave him a hint in his pamphlet, &ldquo;Shooting
Niagara;&rdquo; wherein, sneering at modern bricks and
bricklayers, he says: &ldquo;Bricks, burn them rightly, build
them faithfully with mortar faithfully tempered, <i>they</i> will
stand. . . .&nbsp; We have them here at the head of this garden,
which are in their third or fourth century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long before his day, there had lived, almost on this same
spot, another &ldquo;Hermit of Chelsea,&rdquo; in the person of
Dr. Tobias Smollett; who came here to live in retirement in 1750,
fresh from the fame of his &ldquo;Roderick Random;&rdquo; seeking
such seclusion partly on account of his daughter&rsquo;s health
and his own, and partly for the sake of his work.&nbsp; Here he
wrote &ldquo;Ferdinand Count <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Fathom,&rdquo; finished Hume&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of England,&rdquo; and began his translation of
&ldquo;Don Quixote;&rdquo; and here took place those Sunday
dinners, the delicious description of which, and of the guests,
he has put into the mouth of young Jerry Melford, in
&ldquo;Humphrey Clinker.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here were spent some of his
happiest days, with his work and with his friends from town;
Johnson, Garrick, Sterne, John Wilkes, John Hunter: the latter
probably coming from Earl&rsquo;s Court, Kensington, where his
place&mdash;mansion, museum, and menagerie in one&mdash;stood
till very lately.&nbsp; Smollett was as well known in the streets
of Chelsea, in his day, as Carlyle in ours&mdash;&ldquo;a
good-sized, strongly-made man, graceful, dignified, and
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>It was a fine old place, with extensive grounds, which
Smollett took; being the ancient Manor House of the Lawrences,
once owned by Henry VIII., as we have seen.&nbsp; The house stood
exactly on the site of this block of two-storied brick cottages
called &ldquo;Little Cheyne Row,&rdquo; between Great Cheyne Row
and Lawrence Street.&nbsp; Its early history has little that need
detain us, until, in 1714, it came to be called Monmouth <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>House, from
its new owner, the Duchess of Monmouth and Buccleuch; who came
here with John Gay as her domestic steward or secretary, and who
here lived to the age of ninety.&nbsp; She had been an ornament
of Charles II.&rsquo;s court, a real jewel amidst all the
pinchbeck and paste of his setting.&nbsp; She was the widow of
his son, the hapless Duke of Monmouth; &ldquo;who began life with
no legal right to his being, and ended it by forfeiting all
similar right to his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to this gracious
and gentle <i>chatelaine</i> that Sir Walter Scott sings his
&ldquo;Lay of the Last Minstrel&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For she had known adversity,<br />
Though born in such a high degree;<br />
In pride of power, in beauty&rsquo;s bloom,<br />
Had wept o&rsquo;er Monmouth&rsquo;s bloody tomb.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smollett left the place for ever, in 1769, and a little later,
went to die in Spain; a brave, silent, sad man, for all the fun
in his books, and already broken in health by the untimely death
of his daughter.&nbsp; The Chelsea historian, Faulkner, writing
in 1829, says that Monmouth House was then &ldquo;a melancholy
scene of desolation <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>and ruin.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
finally torn down and carted away in 1834.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The grounds of Monmouth House&mdash;now built over by a great
board-school&mdash;stretched back to those of the Rectory of St.
Luke&rsquo;s, a step to the northward.&nbsp; The Rectory is an
irregular brick building, delightful to the eye, set in an
old-fashioned lawn with great trees; its tranquillity assured by
a high brick wall.&nbsp; It is a very old house, was built by the
Marquis of Winchester, and granted by him to the parish on May
6th, 1566, at the request of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; Glebe Place,
just at hand, shows the site of the glebe land given in her time,
in exchange for the older parsonage, which stood still farther
west, behind Millman&rsquo;s Row, now Millman&rsquo;s Street.</p>
<p>The historic interest of this Chelsea Rectory, however, is
dwarfed by its personal appeal to all of us, for that it was the
home of three notable boys; named, in the order of their ages,
Charles, George, and Henry Kingsley.&nbsp; They came here in the
year 1836; their <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>father, the Rev. Charles Kingsley, having received the
living of St. Luke&rsquo;s, Chelsea, from Lord Cadogan.&nbsp; So
their beloved west-country life was exchanged for the prim,
parochial prosiness, which made such a doleful difference to them
all.&nbsp; For these boys were born, it seems to me, with the
instant love of life and movement in their blood.&nbsp; Charles
has shown it in almost everything he wrote; Henry gave utterance
to it in his books only in a less degree, because it found vent
in his years of wandering; while George&mdash;better known as
&ldquo;The Doctor&rdquo;&mdash;appears for a little while at
spasmodic intervals at his home on Highgate Hill, then plunges
into space again, and is vaguely heard of, now yachting in the
South Seas, now chatting delightfully in a Colorado
mining-camp.&nbsp; Henry, the youngest, was a sensitive, shy lad,
delicate in health; and the old dames in this neighbourhood tell
of his quiet manner and modest bearing.&nbsp; Many of the poor
old women about here have a vivid remembrance of &ldquo;the
boys,&rdquo; and speak of the whole family with respect and
affection.&nbsp; Henry was born in 1830, studied at King&rsquo;s
College, London, for a little over two years, 1844&ndash;6; his
name <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>was
entered at Worcester College, Oxford, March 6th, 1850; where he
kept ten terms, leaving at Easter, 1853, without taking his
degree.&nbsp; The Australian &ldquo;gold-digging fever&rdquo; was
then raging, and he started for that country with two
friends.&nbsp; There he did all sorts of things: tried mining,
tried herding, became a stockman, was in the mounted police; and
after about five years of these varied vocations, returned to
England with no gold in his pockets.&nbsp; It was all in his
brain; a precious possession of experience of life and of men, to
be coined into the characters and the scenes which have passed
current all over the globe.&nbsp; All his Australian stories are
admirable, and &ldquo;Geoffrey Hamlyn&rdquo;&mdash;his first
work, produced soon after his return, in 1859&mdash;is the best
tale of colonial life ever written.&nbsp; His parents had
intended that he should take holy orders, hoping perhaps that he
should succeed his father in the living of old St. Luke&rsquo;s;
but he felt himself utterly unfitted for this profession, as he
also, although with less reason, believed himself unfitted for
that of the journalist.&nbsp; This latter he tried for a while
when he came back to England; and indeed, as a correspondent <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>he
displayed dash enough, and after the surrender of Sedan, was the
first man to enter within the French lines.&nbsp; He found at
length his proper place as an essayist and a novelist.&nbsp; In
all his works, there is to me a strange and nameless
charm&mdash;a quaint humour, a genuine sentiment, an atmosphere
all his own, breezy, buoyant, boyish; seeming to show a
personality behind all his creations&mdash;that of their
creator&mdash;a fair, frank, fresh-hearted man.&nbsp; He had true
artistic talent in another direction, too, inherited from his
grandfather; and he may have been just in judging himself capable
of gaining far greater reputation as a painter than as a
novelist, even.&nbsp; His skill in drawing was amazing, and the
few water-colours and oils left to his family&mdash;and unknown
outside of its members&mdash;are masterpieces.&nbsp; On his
return from Australia, he lived for a while with his mother at
&ldquo;The Cottage,&rdquo; at Eversleigh; never caring for
Chelsea after the death of his father.&nbsp; He was married in
1864 by Charles Kingsley and Gerald Blunt, the present Rector of
Chelsea.&nbsp; On May 24th, 1876, &ldquo;on the vigil of the
Ascension,&rdquo; only forty-six years of age, he died at
Cuckfield, Sussex, <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>which quiet retreat he had chosen twelve months
before.</p>
<p>Henry Kingsley especially appeals to us, just here, for that
he has given us, in &ldquo;The Hillyars and Burtons,&rdquo; so
vivid a picture of modern Chelsea&mdash;its streets and by-ways,
its old houses and its venerable church, in delightful detail, as
he saw them when a boy.&nbsp; The Hillyar family is a romantic
reproduction of that ancient Chelsea family, the Lawrences; in
&ldquo;The Burtons&rdquo; he gives us his reminiscence of the
Wyatt household, living at Wargrave, Henley-on-Thames.&nbsp; The
brave girl, Emma Burton, is a portrait of Emma Wyatt.&nbsp; The
old home of the Burtons&mdash;&ldquo;the very large house which
stood by itself, as it were, fronting the buildings opposite our
forge; which contained twenty-five rooms, some of them very
large, and which was called by us, indifferently, Church Place,
or Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Place&rdquo;&mdash;<i>this</i> was the
only one of the grand mansions just here in Chelsea left standing
when the Kingsleys came here.&nbsp; &ldquo;It had been in reality
the palace of the young Earl of Essex; a very large three-storied
house of old brick, with stone-mullioned <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>windows and
doorways.&rdquo;&nbsp; You may see a print of it in &ldquo;kind
old Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s&rdquo; book, as he found it in 1830,
dilapidated then, and let out to many tenants.&nbsp; Later, it
sunk lower still; and finally the grand old
fabric&mdash;&ldquo;which had been trodden often enough by the
statesmen and dandies of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s court, and most
certainly by that mighty woman herself&rdquo;&mdash;was
demolished between 1840&ndash;42.&nbsp; The boy of ten or twelve
then, Henry Kingsley, must have had the same feelings of wonder
and regret, which he puts into the speech of Jim Burton, as he
looked on this historic pile, roofless, dis-windowed, pickaxed to
pieces.&nbsp; He is not quite correct in letting Jim Burton fix
its site on the south side of Paultons Square; it stood between
that square and Church Street, exactly where now stands a block
of poor little one-storied houses, &ldquo;Paulton Terrace,
1843,&rdquo; painted on its pediment; and at the back, built in
with some still more wretched little dwellings, you shall still
see part of the palace wall of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex,
the son of the Putney blacksmith.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>From
this ancient site I often walk, in company with the Burton
brothers, Joe and Jim, their sister Emma and Erne Hillyar behind,
down old Church Lane, now Church Street, haunted by historic
shades, to where, at its foot, stands &ldquo;Chelsea Old
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four hundred years of memory are crowded into that dark
old church, and the great flood of change beats round the walls,
and shakes the door in vain, but never enters.&nbsp; The dead
stand thick together there, as if to make a brave resistance to
the moving world outside, which jars upon their slumber.&nbsp; It
is a church of the dead.&nbsp; I cannot fancy any one being
married in that church&mdash;its air would chill the boldest
bride that ever walked to the altar.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Joe Burton
well says, sitting in his &ldquo;old place&rdquo;&mdash;the bench
which stood in front of Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s monument, close
to the altar-rails.&nbsp; But for all that, it is not a
depressing but rather a delightful old church, if you sit here of
a summer afternoon; the sun streaming in from the south-west,
slanting on the stone effigies, and the breeze breathing in
through the little door beside More&rsquo;s monument, shaking the
grass outside, and the <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>noble river sparkling beyond the
embankment garden.&nbsp; To me it has more of fascination than
any church in London.&nbsp; Its entire absence of architectural
effect in its varying styles; its retention to this day of the
simplicity of the village church, even as when built; its many
monuments and mural tablets, each one a page of English history;
its family escutcheons; its tattered battle flags hung above; the
living memories that are built in with every dead stone: all
these combine to make it the quaintest, the most impressive, the
most lovable of churches.&nbsp; Dean Stanley was fond of calling
it one of the Chapters of his Abbey.&nbsp; This is not the place
for a description of the monuments, nor for details of their
inscriptions; which make us think, as they did the boy Jim
Burton, that these buried here &ldquo;were the best people who
ever lived.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only the tenant of one plain stone
coffin is modest in his simple request cut thereon: &ldquo;Of
your Charitie pray for the soul of Edmund Bray,
Knight.&rdquo;&nbsp; As for most of the others, I quite agree
with Jim, that the Latin, in which their long epitaphs are
written, was the only language appropriate; the English tongue
being &ldquo;utterly unfit to <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>express the various virtues of these
wonderful Chelsea people;&rdquo; among whom, it strikes me, too,
that &ldquo;Sir Thomas More was the most obstinately determined
that posterity should hear his own account of
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; His black marble slab, set deep under a
plain grey Gothic arch, is placed on the chancel wall, just where
he used to stand in his &ldquo;surplisse;&rdquo; above it is his
punning crest, a Moor&rsquo;s head on a shield; and on it is cut
his own long Latin inscription, sent by him to his friend
Erasmus, who thought it worth printing in his collection of
&ldquo;Tracts and Letters&rdquo; (Antwerp, 1534).&nbsp; Twice
have the characters been recut; and each time has care been
taken, for his memory&rsquo;s sake, to leave blank the last word
of the line, which describes him as &ldquo;troublesome to
thieves, murderers and <i>heretics</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the
sturdy old Catholic these were all equal&mdash;all criminals to
be put out of the way.&nbsp; The irony of chance has placed, on
the wall close beside his tomb, a tablet which keeps alive the
name of one of the Tyndale family, a descendant of that one whose
books More burnt, and whose body he would probably have liked to
burn, also!&nbsp; More&rsquo;s two wives are buried here, as well
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>as
others of his family; but whether his body lies here, or in a
Tower grave, no one knows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Three of Chelsea&rsquo;s grandest ladies lie under monuments
in the church.&nbsp; Lady Dacre, with her husband
Gregory&mdash;&ldquo;their dogs at their feet&rdquo;&mdash;rests
under a Gothic canopy, richly wrought with flowers; tomb and
canopy all of superb white marble.&nbsp; Its sumptuousness is all
the more striking in that it contrasts so strongly with the
simplicity ordered by her dying injunctions, as she wrote them on
December 20, 1594, when decreeing <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>the establishment of her
almshouses&mdash;venerable cottages still standing in Tothill
Street, Westminster, not far from the little street named for
her.&nbsp; In her will she says: &ldquo;And I earnestly desire
that I may be buried in one tombe with my lord at Chelsey,
without all earthlie pompe, but with some privat freindes, and
nott to be ripped, and towling for me, but no ringing, after
service ys done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opposite where she lies, reposes in white marble of the size
of life, under a pillared arch on a black marble pedestal,
another noted Chelsea dame, Lady Jane Cheyne; and on the marble
her worthy husband Charles, transformed here into Carolus,
records in sounding Latin the good she did in her life.&nbsp;
Notably did she benefit this church, towards the re-building of
which she gave largely.</p>
<p>The great Duchess of Northumberland&mdash;mother of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Leicester, grandmother of Sir Philip
Sidney&mdash;was laid to rest under a magnificent tomb; of which
there now is left, to keep alive her memory, here against the
wall, only a slab beneath a noble arch, and faded gilt
escutcheons beautifully wrought.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>And
now, glancing about at the monumental marble and brass of these
soldiers, statesmen, citizens, simple and stately, we are ready
to agree with straight-thinking Jim Burton: &ldquo;But, on the
whole, give me the Hillyars, kneeling humbly, with nothing to say
for themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the Lawrence family, as I have
explained, who are called &ldquo;The Hillyars&rdquo; by Henry
Kingsley; and his preference&mdash;a memory, no doubt, of the
Sunday visits of his boyhood to the rector&rsquo;s pew, which
directly faces these tombs&mdash;refers to that quaint monument
in the Lawrence chapel; where, under a little arch, supported by
columns, kneel wife and husband face to face, he in his armour,
his three simple-seeming sons in ruffs kneeling behind him; she
in her heavy stiff dress, her six daughters on their knees behind
in a dutiful row, decreasing in size to the two dead while yet
babies on the cushion before her.&nbsp; Says Jim: &ldquo;I gave
them names in my own head.&nbsp; I loved two of them.&nbsp; On
the female side I loved the little wee child, for whom there was
very small room, and who was crowded against the pillar, kneeling
on the skirts of the last of her big sisters.&nbsp; And I loved
the big lad, <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>who knelt directly behind his father; between the
Knight himself and the two little brothers, dressed so very like
blue-coat boys, such quaint little fellows as they
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this Lawrence chapel we see a strange survival of a common
custom of the pre-Reformation times; when a great family was wont
to build and own its private chapel in the parish church; using
it for worship during life, for burial in death, and deeding or
bequeathing it, as they did any other real estate.&nbsp; When Sir
Thomas Lawrence became Lord of the Manor, he partly bought, and
partly built, this chapel; and now, although it forms the entire
east end of the north aisle, it has not been modernized like the
rest of the church, but retains its high-backed pews and other
ancient peculiarities unchanged since the church was repaired in
1667; for it is still private property, belonging to the family
to whom it has descended from the Lawrences, and to them goes the
income derived from its pews.</p>
<p>Before going out through the main door we stop to look at the
wooden rack to which the old books are chained, and underneath,
at the little mahogany shelf, <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>for convenience in reading them:
these bring back to us the monkish days.&nbsp; Here is the Bible,
kept since that time when it was so costly a volume; here the
Prayer-book, the Church Homilies, Foxe&rsquo;s Martyrology: this
latter then nearly as sacred as the Scriptures.&nbsp; In the
porch now stands the bell which hung for nearly two hundred years
in the tower, given to the church by &ldquo;the Honourable
William Ashburnham, Esquire, Cofferer to His Majesty&rsquo;s
Household, 1679;&rdquo; so its lettering tells us.</p>
<p>Going, one foggy night of that winter, perhaps from that
Ashburnham House of which we have seen the site, he lost his way,
slipped, and fell into the river; and would have been lost, good
swimmer though he was, unable to see the shore, but that he heard
this church clock strike nine, and so guided, swam safely toward
it.&nbsp; He gave to the church, just then being rebuilt with
Lady Cheyne&rsquo;s funds, this bell, with a sum sufficient to
have it rung for five minutes every night at nine.&nbsp; So was
done for many years&mdash;the ringer receiving &ldquo;a penny
each night and a penny for his candle&rdquo;&mdash;until about
half a century ago the fund <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>vanished, somehow, somewhere; and
this bell has never been rung since!</p>
<p>Outside, the tiny graveyard is crowded with slabs and
monuments, many of them ugly, some curious, a few fine: from the
stately stone tomb of Sir Hans Sloane and his wife&mdash;a marble
urn entwisted with &AElig;sculapian serpents, under a marble
canopy&mdash;to the simple slab, worn with wind and weather, of
Dr. Chamberlayne and his family; of whom the daughter, Anne, more
famous than any of the others, &ldquo;long declining wedlock, and
aspiring above her sex and age, fought under her brother with
arms and manly attire, in a fire-ship against the French, on the
30th June, 1690: a maiden heroine!&rdquo;&nbsp; This &ldquo;Casta
Virago&rdquo; was then but twenty-three, and did not grow in
courage with her years; for she soon after consented to marry one
John Spraggs, and then died!&nbsp; Here and there, amid unknown
graves, we may find those of Magdalen Herbert; Mrs. Fletcher,
wife of the Bishop of London, mother of the Fletcher of the
famous firm &ldquo;Beaumont and Fletcher&rdquo;; Shadwell, the
poet-laureate; Woodfall, the publisher of &ldquo;Junius&rdquo;;
Sir John Fielding, the blind <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>magistrate of Bow Street,
half-brother of the novelist.</p>
<p>Amid these English names is written the name of an historic
Frenchman; and his historic grave is hid somewhere in a corner of
this churchyard, past finding out. <a name="citation160"></a><a
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a>&nbsp; The church
record reads: &ldquo;Burial&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1740, May 18, Brigadier John
Cavallier&rdquo;; and this dry detail of the interment of
&ldquo;only an old officer, who had always behaved very
bravely,&rdquo; is all that is told there of Jean Antoine
Cavallier, the Camissard, the leader of the French Huguenots in
their long, fierce fight against the cruel and lawless
enforcement of Louis XIV.&rsquo;s Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes; refusing to be apostatized, expatriated, or
exterminated.&nbsp; They became the Covenanters of France, and
Cavallier&mdash;a baker&rsquo;s apprentice, with a genuine genius
for war, the soul of the strife, <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>elected their leader before he was
twenty&mdash;was their Black Douglas: one even more furious and
more ferocious.&nbsp; After fire and slaughter and pillage for
two years; affronting the daylight, blazing up the night; amazing
the whole world and horrifying their enemies; banded like bandits
in the hills of Le Puy, singly like guerillas along the range of
the Cevennes; praying, prophesying, slaying:&mdash;they were in
the end circled about by the Grand Monarque&rsquo;s soldiery
under Villars, shut out from Dutch and English aid, from escape
by sea, forced to capitulate.&nbsp; Cavallier was let go to
Jersey, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the island, and
finally closed his stormy career peacefully in London.&nbsp; Here
he lies, in an unknown grave, in this alien soil; and the
C&eacute;venols, up in their hills, still talk of him and of his
war two hundred years ago, to-day as if it were yesterday.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As we stand here, the broad embankment, with its dainty
gardens, stretches between us and the river; spanned just above
by old Battersea Bridge, the only <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>wooden bridge left to the Thames,
since that of Putney has gone.&nbsp; For centuries there had been
a ferry just here, granted by James I. to some of his &ldquo;dear
relations&rdquo; for &pound;40.&nbsp; In 1771 this bridge was
built for foot-passengers only, was enlarged later, and is soon
to be pulled down; its rude and reverend timbers are already
propped up here and there.&nbsp; Stand midway on it with me,
while the ceaseless stream of men flows by, caring nothing for
that at which you and I are looking.</p>
<p>On our right, along the southern shore, stretches Battersea
Park, fringed with its great masses of cool foliage; where not
long ago were marshes and meadows, and the barren, bleak,
Battersea Fields.&nbsp; In those fields was fought the famous
duel in 1829, between the Duke of Wellington and Lord
Winchelsea.&nbsp; And long before that, in the reeds along that
shore was hid Colonel Blood, intending to shoot Charles II. while
bathing, as was the King&rsquo;s custom, &ldquo;in the Thames
over against Chelsey; but his arm was checked by an awe of
Majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, at least, Blood had the impudence to
narrate, when on his trial for his audacious and almost
successful attempt to steal the royal regalia from the <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Tower in
May, 1671.&nbsp; Whether the King was touched by the narrative,
or whether, as has been hinted, his impecunious Majesty was
implicated in the plot to rob the crown; it is certain that he
pardoned the daring adventurer, and gave him a yearly pension of
&pound;500.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Beyond the Bridge, back of us, rises the square, squat tower
of St. Mary&rsquo;s, Battersea, builded in the worst churchwarden
style; and otherwise only notable for that therein was married
Blake the madman; that there Turner loved to sit at the vestry
window and sketch; and that there lie the remains and stand the
magnificent monument of St. John Bolingbroke, and of his second
wife, niece of Madame de Maintenon: both their epitaphs written
by him.&nbsp; Not far from the church, on the river bank next to
the mill, still stands one wing of the great seventy-roomed
Bolingbroke House; in which St. John was born, to which he
returned from his stormy exile, there to pass his remaining days
in study, and there to die.&nbsp; Through its many old-time
chambers with the famous &ldquo;sprawling Verrio&rsquo;s&rdquo;
ceiling paintings, I will lead you into the historic cedar-room,
on the river front&mdash;Bolingbroke&rsquo;s <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>favourite
retreat, whose four walls, panelled with cedar from floor to
ceiling, are still as redolent as when
Pope&mdash;Bolingbroke&rsquo;s guest&mdash;began in it his
&ldquo;Essay on Man,&rdquo; inspired thereto by his host; whose
wit, scholarship, philosophy had, during his exile, inspired also
Voltaire and made him own his master.&nbsp; Here in this room
were wont to meet Bolingbroke and Pope, Chesterfield and
Swift&mdash;that brilliant quartette who hated, plotted against,
and attacked Walpole.&nbsp; His house&mdash;Sir
Robert&rsquo;s&mdash;forms part of the great mass of Chelsea
Hospital, dim in the distance before us; between, stretches the
old Dutch front of Cheyne Walk, near at hand resolving itself
into most ancient houses, with quaint windows in their sloping
roofs; their red tiles and chocolate-brown bricks showing dark
behind the green of the old lime-trees.&nbsp; The setting sun
lingers lovingly on the square church tower, venerable with the
mellow tints of time; and presently the moon comes up, washing
out all these tints, except that of the white wall-tablets; and
from out the grey mass shines the clock-face, even now striking
nine, as it did for the &ldquo;Hon. William,&rdquo; just then
soused in <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>the river, more than two hundred years ago.&nbsp;
Farther beyond the bridge are two buildings, which also bring the
old and the new close together; the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s End
Tavern,&rdquo; at the end of the passage of that name, famous
three centuries ago as a rendezvous for improper pleasure
parties, and introduced in Congreve&rsquo;s &ldquo;Love for
Love,&rdquo; in that connection.&nbsp; Just west of the sedate
little &ldquo;public,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Aquatic Stores,&rdquo;
are two tiny houses set back from the embankment; stone steps
lead down to their minute front gardens; vines clamber up the
front of the westernmost house to an iron balcony on its
roof.&nbsp; That balcony was put there for his own convenience by
Joseph Mallord William Turner, the painter; in that house, No.
119, Cheyne Walk, he lived for many years, and in that front room
he died, on the 18th December, 1851.&nbsp; To that upper window,
no longer able to paint, too feeble to walk, he was wheeled every
morning during his last days that he might lose no light of the
winter sun on his beloved Thames.&nbsp; In Battersea Church you
may sit in the little vestry window wherein he was wont to
sketch.&nbsp; The story of his <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>escape from his grand and gloomy
mansion in Queen Anne Street, is well known; he never returned to
it, but made his home here with the burly Mrs. Booth.&nbsp; After
long hunting, his aged housekeeper, in company with another
decrepid dame, found him in hiding, only the day before his
death.&nbsp; The barber&rsquo;s son of Maiden Lane lies in the
great cathedral of St. Paul&rsquo;s, and the evil that he did is
buried with him&mdash;his eccentricity, his madness if you
will&mdash;but he lives for all time, as the greatest landscape
painter England has known.</p>

<p>The long summer afternoon is waning, and the western sky,
flaming with fading fires, floods broad Chelsea Reach with waves
of dusky gold.&nbsp; The evening mist rises slowly, as yet hiding
nothing, but transforming even commonplace objects in a weird
unwonted way.&nbsp; Those pretentious blocks of new mansions loom
almost lordly now; that distant railway bridge is only a ghost of
graceful glimmering arches; money-making factory chimneys and
commercial wharves pretend to picturesque possibilities; clumpish
barges, sprawling <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>on the mud, are no longer ugly; and a broad-bottomed
coasting schooner, unloading stone at a dock, is just what we
would choose to see there.&nbsp; And here at the end of this
bridge is a fragment of &ldquo;real old Chelsea,&rdquo; left
intact for our delectation&mdash;a cluster of drooping trees on
the bank, an unaccountable boat-house, stone steps leading down
to the bit of beach, whereon are skiffs drawn up, and cordage
lying about, and sail-wrapped spars.&nbsp; Out on the placid
Reach there is but little movement; the river steamboats are
anchored in a dark mass near the shore, and the last belated one
edges up to its mooring beside them for the night; a burly barge
drifts slowly by under its dusky brown sails, or a
&ldquo;dumb-barge&rdquo; floats with the tide, its crew of one
man busied with his long sculls and his not-dumb blasphemy; a
puffing tug with a red light in its nose drags tortuously a long
line of tarpaulin-covered canal boats.&nbsp; As each of these
moving objects breaks the burnished waves into bits of golden
gloom, the whole still surface of the stream becomes alive for us
with a fairy flotilla, born of the brain, yet real enough to our
vision.&nbsp; There float ancient barges, six and eight-oared, <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>gorgeous
with gilding or severely simple; those of brilliant noblemen, of
the City guilds, of Royalty itself.&nbsp; We seem to see Henry
VIII. rowing up, on a visit to More; Elizabeth coming to call on
Lord Charles Howard of Effingham, him who scattered the
&ldquo;Spanyard&rsquo;s Invinsable Navye&rdquo; for her; the
first Charles, impatient to dote on his &ldquo;dear
Steenie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the commonest of these curious craft
is freighted, for our fancy, with a nameless cargo, not on its
bills of lading.&nbsp; So do we gaze across the river of Time
that flows between us and the group of famous men and historic
women, moving in the twilight of the past on Chelsea&rsquo;s
shore.&nbsp; And we ask, with Marcus Piso, friend of the younger
Cicero: &ldquo;Is it by some mutual instinct, or through some
delusion, that when we see the very spots where famous men have
lived, we are far more touched than when we hear of the things
that they have done, or read something that they have
written?&nbsp; It is thus that I am affected at this
moment.&rdquo;</p>

while living here as tutor for the son.&nbsp; Pym, Charles&rsquo;
enemy, who lives on the waterside, stops to look at learned Sir
Joseph Banks, who, after a stormy voyage around the world with
Captain Cook, now tranquilly sits fishing here; Samuel Johnson
strides buoyantly by to his china-making or plods pensively back,
downcast with his failure; Hans Sloane walks arm-in-arm with his
friend Sir Isaac Newton, who has <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>come out here from his house in
Leicester Square; behind them saunter Addison and Dick Steele,
and a more queerly-consorted couple, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas
Carlyle.&nbsp; St. Evremonde goes with one strangely resembling
him superficially&mdash;Leigh Hunt, who lived at the present No.
10, Upper Cheyne Row; and who, &ldquo;with his delicate, worn,
but keenly intellectual face, his large luminous eyes, his thick
shock of wiry grey hair, and little cape of faded black silk over
his shoulders, looks like an old French abb&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Shelley is near them, having come a long way from his lodgings in
Hans Place; where he has for a neighbour a certain Joseph
Balsamo, calling himself the Count Cagliostro, living in Sloane
Street.&nbsp; The Dandy D&rsquo;Orsay cautiously threads his way,
for he is in hiding from his creditors.&nbsp; Turner passes,
gazing on his river; and Maclise, who lives here on the bank and
dies here too, painting the Thames.&nbsp; Dante Gabriel Rossetti
and his near neighbour George Eliot go by; and, last of all,
Henry Kingsley with the boy Joe Burton, whom he loves, and whom
we love, too.</p>
<p>The puffing tug shrieks, and puts to flight these <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>vagrant
fancies of an American, sentimentalizing in Chelsea; and so ends
his stroll, his returning footsteps echoing the words of Goethe,
and reminding him that, after all, &ldquo;You find in Rome only
what you take there.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote26"></a><a href="#citation26"
class="footnote">[26]</a>&nbsp; This illustration and those on
pages 114 and 123, have been made from photographs by J.
Hedderly, and are admirable specimens of the many taken by him
during a long and laborious life, and which have genuine artistic
merit as well as historic value in their preservation of the
features of Old Chelsea.&nbsp; Hedderly&rsquo;s was the curious
case of a man living for fifty years in daily contact with the
ancient and the odd, and yet always keen to appreciate it and
accurate in seizing it.&nbsp; On his death, in 1885, his plates
went to his daughter, and the photographs can be bought from
George White, Printer, 396, King&rsquo;s Road, just at the end of
Park Walk: by whose permission these photographs have been
re-drawn.</p>
<p><a name="footnote31"></a><a href="#citation31"
class="footnote">[31]</a>&nbsp; One of her school-mates here, by
the way, was that Miss Roberts who wrote so well about India;
another was Lady Caroline Lamb, heroine of the scissors-stabbing
scene for Byron&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; And among other scholars here
at other times we find names famous in later life, as that of
Lady Bulwer, of Mrs. S. C. Hall, of Miss Mary Russell
Mitford.&nbsp; The latter lady lived for several years after her
school days at No. 33, Hans Place.&nbsp; In No. 41 lodged Percy
Bysshe Shelley, at one time.&nbsp; These two last-named houses
have been raised two stories, and renewed; while Nos. 22 and 25
have been recently torn down and rebuilt.&nbsp; Thus every house
in Hans Place having historic association has been ruined for us,
and others of no interest from our point of view in this stroll
are left intact in their age&mdash;a queer fatality which I find
to have pursued too many buildings of old London!</p>
<p><a name="footnote48"></a><a href="#citation48"
class="footnote">[48]</a>&nbsp; The painting in the National
Portrait Gallery is a copy by an unknown&mdash;withal a
skilful&mdash;hand, of Holbein&rsquo;s crayon sketch, now in
Windsor Castle.&nbsp; Its most striking feature is More&rsquo;s
mouth: these lips seem to speak to us at once with sweetness and
with sternness.</p>
<p><a name="footnote57"></a><a href="#citation57"
class="footnote">[57]</a>&nbsp; In our reproduction of this rare
print in the British Museum of about the year 1682, Lindsey House
is seen on the river bank at the extreme left; behind it is a
building in the Dutch style, concerning which I can find no
record anywhere; More&rsquo;s mansion stands on the slope
half-way up to King&rsquo;s Road, in the midst of its
&ldquo;great extent of profitable garden and pleasure
ground;&rdquo; behind and to its left are the stables and
out-buildings.&nbsp; Just beyond King&rsquo;s Road, on the left,
may be seen the small settlement named then and known now as
&ldquo;Little Chelsea.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the far distance, rise, on
their wooded slopes, Holland, Camden, and Kensington
Houses.&nbsp; The gate-house of Inigo Jones shows plainly towards
the front, and from it the broad walk&mdash;now Beaufort
Street&mdash;leads to the river and the ferry, just at the spot
where now springs Battersea Bridge.</p>
<p><a name="footnote58"></a><a href="#citation58"
class="footnote">[58]</a>&nbsp; You may see a picture of such a
scene&mdash;the sermon to a group of negroes&mdash;in the old
Moravian chapel in Fetter Lane.&nbsp; Here, too, are many relics
of interest of the man: his chair, with claw feet and curious
carvings; his queer old-German Hymn-book, printed in 1566, with
metal clasps and corners; and his portrait, life-size and in
oil.</p>
<p><a name="footnote80"></a><a href="#citation80"
class="footnote">[80]</a>&nbsp; There lies on my desk, as I
write, a copper token, which I lately picked up in a shabby shop
of Red Lion Passage, High Holborn.&nbsp; It is about the size of
a penny piece, and on it is stamped &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Ranelagh House</span>, 1745:&rdquo; these raised
letters as clearly cut as on the day when coined.&nbsp; It
pleases me to wonder which and how many of the men I mention
above may have handed in this piece at the entrance gate.</p>
<p><a name="footnote91"></a><a href="#citation91"
class="footnote">[91]</a>&nbsp; Henri, Marquis of Ruvigny, fled
from France on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, came to
England, was here naturalized, and received the title of Count of
Galloway.</p>
<p><a name="footnote109"></a><a href="#citation109"

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
